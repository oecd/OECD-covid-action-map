AUS		June 24, 2020		-24.578	133.582	Australia	A variety of facilities closed for at least the next six months, including restaurants, cafés, gyms, sporting venues and places of worship. Schools still remain open, but some state governments (notably Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory) have signalled an intention to unilaterally embark on school closures. Public gatherings of more than two people are banned as is overseas travel for Australian citizens.   Any arrivals in Australia are quarantined for 14 days.  The deconfinement plan is as follows: • Step 1 will allow gatherings of up to 10 people, up to 5 visitors in the family home and some local and regional travel (within-state). Some retail and small cafes and restaurants will also be able to reopen. • Step 2 will allow gatherings of up to 20 people, and the reopening of gyms, beauty services and entertainment venues like galleries and cinemas. • Step 3 will allow gatherings of up to 100 people. Arrangements under step 3 will be the ‘new normal’ while the virus remains a threat. International travel and mass gatherings over 100 people will remain restricted. The government has also released the CovidSafe App for tracing potential outbreaks. 		As of 20/03, sick or injured workers who cannot do their usual work or study can receive unemployment benefits (Job Seeker Payment), in addition to two weeks of employer paid sick pay (accrued because of one year tenure) For COVID-19 cases, the income means test of the UB has been increased and the asset limit and job-seeking requirement has been suspended (but it still has a means test component). The requirement to provide a medical certificate to apply for the Job Seeker Payment has been waived for people who cannot work or study because of the coronavirus. The exact benefit level depends on family situation. Moreover, the gov’t has adopted income top-ups for individuals who receive an eligible income support (including UB and sickness allowance), with the Coronavirus supplement and the One-off Economic Support Payment.   	Private-sector employees in mandatory quarantine or self-isolation are not entitled to employer-paid sick pay. They can take two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave if they cannot access other leave entitlements. However, they can receive the JobSeeker Payment (UB) in case of mandatory quarantine due to COVID-19 if they meet the other required requirements. Also applies to self-employed and casual workers.   Social assistance scheme: Workers in quarantine or self-isolation can also get a Crisis Payment (Special Benefit), which is a last resort payment for those not eligible to other payments (such as JobSeeker Payment). It depends on current income, not previous earnings. 	The Early Childhood Education and Care Relief Package is a payment to support childcare services, including Centre Based Day Care, Family Day Care, Outside School Hours Care and In Home Care, to remain open. To receive these payments child support services must prioritise care to essential workers, vulnerable and disadvantaged children and previously enrolled children, must not charge any fees for sessions of care provided.  With the COVID-19 outbreak, employees (incl. casual workers) are entitled to take 2 days of unpaid carer’s leave if they have to look after a family member who is sick with the COVID-19 or to care for a child due to the school closures (only if they have no paid sick or carer’s leave left for full-time or part-time employees). Australia also expanded access to income support payments to persons required to take care of someone affected by COVID-19. Workers (incl. casual workers & the self-employed) can receive the JobSeeker payment if they care for someone who is affected by COVID-19. Those not entitled to the Job Seeker payment can receive the Crisis Payment (Special Benefit) if they are caring for someone required to be in quarantine or self-isolation.	Temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight. This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. The supplement will be paid for the next six months. Social security and veteran income support recipients and eligible concession card holders who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive a $750 one-off payment (in addition to a $750 one-off payment already announced in the government’s first stimulus package). The Government has also taken measures to support retirees.  Sole traders, self-employed, casual workers and contract workers are entitled to the Job Seeker Payment & Coronavirus Supplement in case of sickness or mandatory quarantine, if they meet the required criteria.	Wage subsidy to businesses (A$130bn or 6½% of GDP) to encourage them to keep workers in jobs. A “JobKeeper Payment” of A$1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee will be paid to the business under the condition that every eligible employee receives at least A$ 1,500 per fortnight from the business. The Jobkeeper Payment covers full-time and part-time employees, as well as employees stood down ahead of the commencement of the scheme, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months and the self employed. Eligible businesses are those with a turnover of less than A$1 billion that can demonstrate a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable month one year ago (firms with turnover of greater than A$1 billion must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in turnover).  The Government is supporting small business to retain their apprentices and trainees. Eligible employers can apply for a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice’s or trainee’s wage for 9 months from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. Where a small business is not able to retain an apprentice, the subsidy will be available to a new employer that employs that apprentice	The Government plan to support businesses in managing short-term cash flow challenge is manifold: - Boosting Cash Flow for Employers: up to $100,000 to eligible small and medium-sized businesses, and not-for-profits (NFPs) that employ people, with a minimum payment of $20,000. - Temporary relief for financially distressed businesses: The Government is temporarily increasing the threshold at which creditors can issue a statutory demand on a company and to initiate bankrupt proceedings against. - Increasing the instant asset write-off from $30,000 to $150,000 and expanding access to include businesses with aggregated annual turnover of less than $500 million (up from $50 million) until 30 June 2020. - Backing business investment: time-limited 15 month investment incentive (through to 30 June 2021) to support business investment and economic growth over the short term, by accelerating depreciation deductions. - Co-ordinated actions have been taken by the Government, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to ensure the flow of credit in the Australian economy.

Teleworking encouraged when possible since 12th of March 	If the employee is on sick leave because of the coronavirus infection (incapacity to work due to illness), his or her right to sick pay is determined on the basis of the Employment Contracts Act and collective agreements. Payment of salaries during sick leave is included in sectoral collective agreements.   Workers ill because of COVID-19 are entitled to the infectious disease allowance paid by the Finnish Social Security/Insurance Institution (KELA), which differs from normal "sickness allowance" received in case of incapacity to work due to illness other than COVID-19. Full compensation for the loss of income suffered, provided during the whole period of absence.   It is recommended that the employee's own statement is sufficient to justify the sick-leave pay.	Sickness allowance on account of an infectious disease to cover loss of income is available only if this has been ordered by the physician responsible for infectious disease control in the relevant municipality or hospital district. No entitlement when i) ordered by employer to stay at home after returning from abroad, ii) need to stay at home because of closure of child care centres or schools, iii) working remotely without loss of income, iv) precautionary quarantine. Temporary financial assistance due to an epidemic outbreak (see column G) can also be paid to persons arriving in Finland from abroad who have been placed in conditions equivalent to quarantine and are therefore forced to take unpaid leave from work. 	Parent employees taking unpaid leave to care for a child who normally would be in early childhood education or school are entitled to a "Temporary financial assistance due to an epidemic outbreak" benefit. The benefit is paid at a flat-rate of  EUR 28.94 per working day (EUR 723.50 per month). The temporary benefit is available until 13 May 2020, when schools and early childhood education facilities are due to re-open. It can be paid retroactively from 16 March 2020. Available to employees only. Paid by public social insurance.  Parents are also entitled to paid sick leave if they cannot work because they need to care for a child under age 16 who has been placed in quarantine. Paid at 100% of earnings. Payment is made through the employer, who is reimbursed by public social insurance. This is available to both employees and the self-employed. 	Temporary recognition of entrepreneurs and freelancers as unemployment benefit recipients until 30 June (extended to 31 December). Elimination of waiting period for unemployment benefits. Special guidelines to municipalities granting supplementary and preventive social assistance (prioritization of cases totally without other incomes, granting preventive social assistance if there are delays granting basic social assistance in Kela/Social Insurance Institution), municipalities are not recommended to apply reductions of social assistance due to non-compliance (e.g. person refuses to accept a work offer or does not participate in training or certain other activating or integration measures). Temporary increase in disregard for adjusted unemployment benefits payable between 1.6. 2020 and 31.10.2020. For benefits payable for this period the disregard is EUR 500 per month (normally EUR 300 per month).  The adjusted (reduced) unemployment benefit may be paid to unemployed persons working e.g. part-time or reduced hours. The condition of mobility allowance where relaxed for the same period (1.6.-31.10.2020).  The required period of employment for wage-earners will be shortened. Fulfilling the required period of employment is a prerequisite for receiving unemployment allowance. The required period of employment will be 13 calendar weeks instead of the present 26 calendar weeks. For non-owner family members of entrepreneurs the required period of employment will be 26 calendar weeks instead of the present 52 calendar weeks. Unemployment allowances paid on the grounds of layoffs will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum period of payment that applies to the unemployment allowance. This amendment will improve unemployment security should the unemployment be prolonged. The Acts entered into force on 15 April 2020 and will remain in force until 6 July 2020. The amendments will be applied retroactively, starting on 16 March 2020. 	Temporary lay-off procedures (STW) have been fastened to avoid bankruptcies (i.e. the notice period will be shortened from 14 to five days).	Loan guarantees for firms (4% of GDP), most notably via Finnvera, the state’s financing and export credit company. Increase of grants (0.1% of GDP): the public funding agency Business Finland's grant authorisations will be increased to permit immediate business support measures.  The government’s additional budget gives ELY Centres (Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) €400 million in additional resources for funding businesses. The funding is distributed in the form of development assistance.  	Starting from 1 April 2020, employers have the right to lay off an employee in a fixed-term employment relationship under the same conditions as an employee with an employment contract of unspecified duration. This amendment is intended to be in force for three months, or until 30 June 2020.		https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus

In addition, for employees: waiving of the 7-day waiting period to receive the supplementary employer allowance for sickness absence related to COVID-19. Applies until 10 July 2020 (end of the state of health emergency).  Coverage of paid sick-leave (without firm cost-sharing) of workers who will have to stay home to take care of their children.  COVID-19 will be systematically and automatically recognised as an occupational disease for all health and care workers (including self-employed carers). This implies full coverage of medical care, increased daily allowances, and increased protections associated with this type of risk.	There are two different systems for employees (insured under the general regime of social security) who received health instructions to self-isolate (as of 1st of May – before this date sickness benefits applied to all cases of quarantine): 1. Paid sick leave and sickness benefits (PSLSB): for employees who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. The persons concerned receive sickness benefits (daily allowances) paid by the health insurance and paid sick leave (supplementary compensation) by the employer.  2. Short-time working benefits (STW): for employees in the private sector who are required to self-isolate because they (1) have an elevated health risk (e.g. pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy or people suffering from a long-term condition, chronic diseases patients); or (2) live with another vulnerable person. The standard STW conditions apply. No waiting period for both.	Before 1 May 2020, working parents (employees and the self-employed) with children under age 16 affected by school closure and/or self-isolation were entitled to paid sick leave (paid at 90% of gross earnings for the first 30 days) if no alternative care or work (e.g. teleworking) arrangements could be found. From 1 May 2020, for parent employees, a similar arrangement applies but the parent is placed on the short-time work scheme (see right). Payment under the new scheme equals 70% of gross salary (about 84% of the net salary), and 100% for employees on the minimum wage. Self-employed parents continue to have a right to paid sick leave under the previous scheme. Paid by public social insurance.  Some schools and childcare facilities remain open, with a skeleton staff, to look after children of essential service workers.	Creation of a solidarity fund for small companies. Coverage of very small businesses (turnover < €1M), self-employed workers and micro entrepreneurs experiencing a very sharp drop in turnover (70% loss between March 2020 and March 2019) or subject to administrative closure. Unemployed people will continue receiving their benefits and the confinement period will not be counted in the calculations of unemployment benefit rights (including for the so-called intermittents du spectacle).Temporary agency workers will be paid for the entire duration of their assignment as initially foreseen even if they cannot work because of the confinement measures. People who quit a job for another one but could not be hired for the crisis are granted exceptional access to the unemployment insurance. Craftsmen and retail traders will get a one-off tax-free payment of max 1250 euros (financed by drawing on the supplementary pension scheme for these self-employed workers thanks to an agreement with the employers' association).	Extension of short-time work schemes (including domestic work) through higher coverage of workers’ payments (100% at the minimum wage and 84% of higher gross wages  up to a maximum of 4.5 SMIC) and the absence of cost sharing for firms and granting companies a period of thirty days to file their request, with retroactive effect; solidarity fund will cover up to 80% of their net income. Some derogations to maximum working hours to allow essential services to work more hours if need be. Companies may also impose annual leave to all employees.	Postponements of social security contributions and corporate/personal income tax payments for firms and entrepreneurs, and, on a case-by-case basis, exemptions from these payments. Up to EUR 300 billion of public guarantees (12.4% of GDP) for business loans	Economic dismissals will be subjected to increased scrutiny.	Extension of the seasonal suspension of evictions from dwellings until the end of July (la trêve hivernale).  The government has requisitioned hotel rooms for homeless people to be used for confinement.   Extension of emergency housing spaces that are made available during the winter period; in addition, 7,000 beds previously available only in the winter will be made available all year long.  Postponement of planned reform to the housing subsidy (APL), which was set to be implemented on 1 April 2020. 	https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus https://www.cohesion-territoires.gouv.fr/en/node/44540

The self-employed also have the right to an income replacement from the health ministry if there is a concrete and certified suspicion of infection.	Working parents with children under age 12 who have not been able to work due to school or child care closures have been entitled to six weeks of paid leave, paid at 67% of earnings up to the ceiling of EUR 2016 per month. The leave is paid by the employer who then claims compensation from the relevant state authority. In addition, the government has simplified the application process for the child supplement, a means-tested in-work benefit. During the confinement phase, some schools and childcare facilities remained open, with a skeleton staff, to look after children of essential service workers.	Self-employed persons and freelancers will receive compensation for loss of earnings based on the profits established in the tax declaration of the previous calendar year. The ruling coalition agreed to extend the maximum unemployment benefit duration by three months for all claimants whose entitlements end between 1 Mai and 31 December.

In the seventh month, payments are increased further to 80% and 87% respectively.	Germany has protected businesses with liquidity measures, authorising the state-owned bank KfW to lend out €610 billion to companies to cushion the effects of the coronavirus. To support the recovery of restaurants, the reduced VAT rate of 5% will be applied to this sector for 12 months starting on 1 July. The economic stimulus package from 12 June includes a comprehensive support program for small and medium-sized companies that are particularly badly affected by the corona crisis. 		As of 1 April, missed rent payments due to COVID-related reasons cannot lead to evictions and rent payments for these tenants will be postponed (in force until 30 June). Rents need to be paid in full afterwards (by 30 June 2022) to ensure no losses for landlords.

Following a recommandation of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour due to the COVID-19 crisis, they may be entitled to continue to receive benefits even if they have used up their all their 12 months. Applies to employees and self-employed workers.	Quarantine payments: the aim is to support employers who pay wages to employees who have been quarantined when other entitlements, such as sick leave per collective agreements, do not apply (period of February 1st 2020 until April 30th 2020 and applications must be submitted before July 1st 2020). Self-employed workers can also receive sickness benefits (“quarantine payments”) when in quarantine. 	Families with children under 18 will receive a one-off child benefit payment on 1 June 2020 worth ISK 30 000 or ISK 42 000 per child, depending on income.	Reduced Employment ratio:  payment of unemployment benefits up to 75% of salary for short-term workers or unemployed. The self-employed and freelancers are also eligible for this benefit. Wages paid alongside reduced unemployment ratio do not deplete unemployment benefits (between March 15th and June 1st  2020).   ISK 2.2bn to create 3,000 temporary summer jobs for students aged 18 and over.	Reduced Employment ratio: workers who see their working hours reduced are entitled to the payment of unemployment benefits. The new provisions are valid from March 15th until June 1st  2020. The measure is intended to encourage employers to maintain employment relationships instead of using layoffs. It consists of employees and employers making a temporary agreement to reduce employees´ employment ratio. It is then possible to apply for unemployment benefits alongside the reduced employment ratio. The employee’s employment ratio must be reduced by at least 20% and cannot be reduced further down than 25% (Therefore in order for this measure to apply an employee must have been in at least 45% employment before the reducement). This option has been extended to 31 August, with a possible reduction in hours or salary to as low as 25%, or 50% from July onwards. An application must be filed for an extension, and the requirements for participation will be reviewed.

IRL		June 24, 2020		53.214	-7.588	Ireland	Schools are closed, travel restrictions, large gatherings are banned, social distancing measures 	Teleworking encouraged when possible	Rules for Illness Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance will be changed to help prevent the transmission of coronavirus. The changes mean that if a worker is diagnosed with COVID-19, or are suspected of having COVID-19 and are medically required to self-isolate (see right), she can get income support without having to wait for 6 days and for up to 10 weeks in case of infection. She can apply for Enhanced Illness Benefit from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which grants EUR350 per week per person, and is expanded for adults with dependent children. Self-employed can now access the scheme, too. These provisions only apply to private sector workers. The Enhanced Illness Benefit provision is meant to be complemented by the employer sick leave provisions. If this cannot happen, the worker can apply for a Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The means test for Supplementary Welfare Allowance will be removed if a person is medically required to self-isolate or are diagnosed with COVID-19. 	The Enhanced Illness Benefit is also available to workers (including the self-employed) who have been advised by a doctor to self-isolate and who are confined to their homes or to a medical facility and cannot work remotely. No waiting period and same level as in case of sickness by COVID-19. However, maximum duration of 2 weeks. Workers self-isolating for other reasons (e.g. because feel that they are at risk) without medical certification do not qualify.	No new measures. Workers already had the right to take 3 days force majeure leave in a 12-month period, or 5 days in a 36 month period. You can ask your employer to allow you to take the full 5 days paid force majeure leave together.

New COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The payment will be available to all employees and the self-employed who have lost employment due to a downturn in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The payment has a simple one–page application form and will be paid for a period of 12 weeks at a flat rate payment of 350 euros per week for jobseekers. Recipients of a number of welfare allowances prior to the crisis can cumulate those with the Unemployment Payment. Self-employed who pay themselves as "Pay As You Earn" can apply for the "Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme"; those who do not can apply to the "COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment". Extra provisions are made for households with numerous children. 	If the employer can show that s/he lost at least 25 percent of business, s/he can apply to a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme. The COVID-19 Wage Subsidy allows employers to pay their employees during the current pandemic. Employers will be refunded up to 70 percent of an employee's wages - capped at a maximum weekly tax free payment of 410 euros per employee which is equivalent to 70% of the net weekly income for someone on 38,000 euros per annum. A special supplement has been introduced for the particular needs of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sectors.  The Short-time Work Support (STWS) Scheme is an income support payment – a form of Jobseekers Benefit – for employees who have been temporarily placed on a shorter working week.

The entitlement is an individual entitlement - in a couple family, both parents are entitled to 10 days paid family care leave each.  In addition, the government has also raised employer subsidies for shorter working hours for family care from March to June, coupled with relaxed eligibility criteria: the subsidy for indirect labour costs has increased from KRW 200 thousand to KRW 400 thousand per month; the subsidy for wage reduction compensation from KRW 400 thousand to KRW 600 thousand per month; and the subsidy for replacement workers from KRW 600 thousand to KRW 800 thousand per month.

On the top of this, consumption vouchers are provided to low-income households. The supplementary budget passed on 17 March includes subsidies to intermediate governments which will be used for employment protection programmes for non-regular workers and daily workers. The government and the National Assembly decided to offer “emergency disaster relief payments” of KRW 14.3 trillion to all households. A total of 22 million households to become recipients. Payments to vary according to the household members: KRW 0.4 million (single-person households), KRW 0.6 million (two-person households), KRW 0.8 million (three-person households), KRW 1 million (four or more-person households). The government initially decided to exclude the top 30 percent by income for the one-time direct financial support, but it later expanded the scope of beneficiaries to all households. Instead, the government is campaigning to encourage the wealthy to donate their share. Donations will be injected into the Employment Insurance Fund to be used to help maintain employment and support those who have lost their jobs. In a similar vein, Seoul will pay up to KRW 500 000 to households whose income are below a designated level. Jeonju introduced "disaster basic income" amounting KRW 527 000, which will be provided on April, for non-regular workers and the unemployed.

The government decided to further increase the level of subsidy for three months (from April to June) up to 90 percent of the wage paid for SMEs. The government decided to expand the social security contribution reliefs with the 3 months payment deferrals and the 30% contribution rate reductions for small businesses and low income households. The government will also provide electricity bill payment deferral for three months to SMEs and low income households. “Declaration of a tripartite agreement to overcome the 'COVID-19' crisis (March 6)” and “Health care sector Tripartite Agreement” on how to overcome 'COVID-19' crisis (March 19). Both declarations include labour-management-government efforts to maintain employment while curbing Covid-19.

Expedite permission on overtime in businesses related to corona crisis (e.g., masks and disinfection products)	The National Assembly of Korea passed an extra budget bill worth more than KRW 10 trillion to help fight against the new coronavirus, which includes supports for the low-income households and small businesses. The government announced that it will increase the financial support package to KRW 135 trillion from KRW 50 trillion to ease the financial burden on small businesses and self-employed. The government will establish the key industry stabilization fund (KRW 40 trillion) to support seven industries suffering from financial difficulties: airlines, shipping, automobiles, shipbuilding, machinery, power, and communications. Support will only be given under the condition of overall employment being maintained, prevention of moral hazard such as effort on their part, and profit sharing from normalization of enterprises. Designating “special employment support sectors” for increased levels of employment security support from among those hit hardest by the outbreak, such as the travel industry, tourist accommodation services and performing arts industry.

If health care professionals, officials or other employees are infected with the illness for which the emergency is declared, they are offered a maximum sickness benefit of 100 percent from net pay. Law on Sickness and Maternity Social Insurance (Art. 11-1) stipulates that a person who, during an emergency situation or quarantine announced by the gov't, has performed professional activities which are related with direct contact with individual who has dangerous contagious illness (such as COVID-19) and for which the gov't has declared an emergency situation or quarantine - will be paid a higher amount of sickness benefit than 'standard' sickness benefit. This benefit is paid from the State Social Insurance Fund (SODRA) and is equal to 77.58% of the amount of the beneficiary's compensatory earnings.Eligibility to this higher sickness benefit should be determined on an individual basis upon submission by the employer of documents substantiating the causal link between the performance of professional activities and illness.   If a worker suffers from a serious chronic illness listed on a list approved by the Minister of Health and has no access to remote work or idle time, he or she would be able to receive sickness benefit during an emergency. The benefit will be 62.02 percent of the gross salary.

Sick leave and sickness benefit will be issued for up to 60 days, but no longer than the end of quarantine or emergency, paid by the Sodra. 	Parents with children up to age who are not able to work due to school or child care facility closures, as well as other workers who provide care for disabled or elderly people, are entitled to up to 60 days paid leave until the end of the emergency.

Working grandparents are also included in childcare so that they can receive sick pay and sickness benefits for the care of a child in good health (enrolled at kindergarten, pre-school or elementary school) or a disabled person under 21 years old who is attending an educational institution.	Self-employed persons who have paid social security contributions for at least 3 months during the last year prior to the declaration of emergency will be paid a lump sum from the Guarantee Fund. The monthly benefit will amount to the minimum consumption requirement for the current year, which is € 257 per month. The benefit will be available through the Employment Service but will not be paid to self-employed persons who work under an employment contract.  Unemployed registered with the VET program receive training will keep receiving a scholarship of € 236, even though the education process itself is temporarily inaccessible or is carried out remotely.

Workers in mandatory quarantine issued by doctor from the Health Department or the Health Inspectorate are eligible to sickness benefit with the same waiting period, level and duration as someone who is sick. In this case, the days of quarantine are covered by Social Security.  Moreover, there is no accidental or involuntary technical unemployment scheme applicable in the event of a risk of epidemic. For the other employees constrained by mandatory quarantine measures and who cannot telework, the employer would have no choice but to grant extraordinary leave to the employee(s) with continued pay without counting a single day of ordinary leave (possibility of request for STW).

MEX		June 24, 2020		22.925	-101.68	Mexico	On 30 March, the Ministry of Health declared a national sanitary emergency. All non essential activities are suspended until April 30. The entire population residing in Mexican territory is encouraged to voluntarily remain home, while the confinement is mandatory for anyone over 60 years of age, pregnant women, or people with chronic or autoimmune diseases. Even in sectors deemed essential (such as healthcare and law enforcement), meetings of more than 50 people cannot be held and basic hygiene, prevention and healthy distance measures should always be applied.  On may 13, the government announced today its reopening plan, which in three stages. 	Only essential activities are allowed. Teleworking encouraged when possible. People aged 60 and above, pregnant women and people with chronic or autoimmune diseases are dispensed from going to work. Firms have to: (i) provide sanitary products and personal protective equipment to working people; (ii) organize schedules for the use of facilities in order to decrease the contact; (iii) separate shared workstations at a distance of 1.50 to 2 meters. More generally, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (STPS) launched the "Together for Work" ("Juntos por el Trabajo") initiative to share with workers, employers and the general public a set of tools, guidelines, training courses and practical advices about the changes in the labour market due to Covid-19.	Usually, a worker (formal sector) covered by social security who cannot work due to sickness can access to paid sick leave from the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), with a compensation of  60% of the wage registered by the employer for up to 78 weeks.  According to an amendment of the LFT made in 2009, when a sanitary contingency is emitted by the authorities, the employer must pay workers the monthly minimum wage (3,966 pesos = 150 euros), with maximum duration of 1 month (article 42 bis). This applies in the current COVID-19 outbreak context.  Previously, the sickness benefit had a 3-day waiting period and level of 915.78 pesos.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) is issuing paid sick leaves online.					Some States are taking different actions to support SMEs in the formal and informal sectors, including discounts on payroll taxes for SME's and credit lines for payment of payrolls or supply merchandise for SMEs. The Federal Government, through the development bank Nacional Financiera (Nafin), will support SMEs up to MXN 36.3 billion (USD 1 billion). Out of one million credit products of MXN 25 000 each (USD 1 000); 500 000 of them will be provided to the formal economy and 500 000 loans will be extended to the informal economy. The loans will be settled over a period of 3 years, with no payment in the first three months and further monthly payments of MXN 1 000 (USD 42), at an average rate of 6.5% per year. The Government will further boost the economy by providing new financing of at least MXN 24.8 billion via other development banks.	The Ministry of Labor and Social Security (STPS) stressed that there is no legal basis to separate workers or unilaterally modify working conditions due to Covid-19. As such, the Federal Attorney for Labor Defense (PROFEDET) opened a website to foster social dialogue, so that workers and employers can reach beneficial agreements for both parties (https://procuraduriadigital.stps.gob.mx/). The website also provides legal advice to affected workers.	Starting from 15 April, the National Institute for Workers' Housing (INFONAVIT) covers up to 3 months of credit payments for workers who become unemployed. This extension will continue up to 6 months without additional charges.	https://coronavirus.gob.mx/  http://juntosporeltrabajo.stps.gob.mx/

If the employee is not able to work from home, then an employer may apply on behalf of the employee for sickness benefits instead.	Some schools and childcare facilities remain open, with a skeleton staff, to look after children of essential service workers. These services are provided free of charge for families in which at least 1 parent performs essential services (education, healthcare, childcare, food sector, key transport, key public sector).

Shut down of cultural and sports events. On 31 March, the authorities closed hotels, temporary accommodation services, hairdressers, public parks and churches. On April 16, compulsory face covering in public was introduced.  On April 20, the first stage of lifting restrictions starts: more people are allowed entering the shops; it is allowed to enter forests and parks, as well as run or ride a bike. Since May 4th, Poland is progressively lifting the restrictions introduced to limit the COVID-19 contagion. 	On 8 March, a special remote work mode has been introduced, according to which employers are allowed to order their workers to perform specific work defined in their employment contracts for a fixed period of time outside the regular place of work.	In the COVID-19 outbreak context, there is a possibility to get a proper medical certificate without visiting a doctor: possible to have the medical check on-line or by telephone. 	Sick leave is granted for the periods of quarantine if individually ordered by the authorities, with same rules as in the case of a sick worker (same benefit level and duration). Also applies to self-employed workers. Benefits for childcare are granted in case children are under quarantine. These do not apply to people self-quarantining.   From April 7, an allowance, amounting to 50% of the minimum wage, will be paid to farmers and their household members during the period in which they are subject to quarantine or hospitalisation.

Insured parents with children up to age 8 affected by closures of nurseries and schools are entitled to an exceptional 28-day family care leave (14 days per parent). If both parents of the child work, the leave can be shared but only one parent may use the leave at any one time. The allowance is funded by public social insurance. This entitlement is in addition to the existing 60-day family care leave already provided in Poland. Even if the employer pays the benefit (if required to do so), the amounts paid are settled by the National Social Insurance Institution, meaning that the benefits are not charged to the employers' fund. 	One-off cash payment up to PLN 2080 (80% of minimum wage) for self-employed and workers employed under civil law contracts. The benefit is not taxed. On April 7, extended to up to three months.

Employers will cover an additional 40%, while the worker will have to bear the remaining loss. The subsidy is provided on the condition that the employer will not make any employees redundant. The expected costs of STW measure together with the allowance to self-employed are around 1.3% of 2019 GDP. The scheme will be managed by the state-owned Polish Development Fund (PFR), which will fund it by issuing state-guaranteed bonds (to be purchased by the National Bank of Poland on the secondary market as part of its QE programme). State-support for the protection of jobs extended to NGOs, non-profit and public benefit organisations. On 8 April, the government launched a PLN 100 billion (around EUR 22 billion or 4.5% of GDP) financial lifeline to companies, to reduce incentives to lay-off workers in the current downturn. The scheme will consist of 3-year zero-interest loans to struggling SMEs (50% of the envelope), micro-enterprises (25%) and large companies (25%). About 60% of total loans will be disbursed in the form of grants (up to 75% for SMEs and micro-enterprises), provided recipients will keep their employees during the loan period.

PRT		June 24, 2020		40.957	-7.799	Portugal	Schools are closed, non-essential shops and public spaces are closed. Public containment measures have been implemented.		Parents, employed as dependent employees, who need to stay home to take care of their kids (up to 12 years old) after school closures, and who cannot telework, have their leave from work “justified”, i.e. they cannot be laid-off for unjustified leave. In addition, in order to help their employers cope with their leave, they will only receive 2/3 of their salary during that period. These 2/3 of salary will be paid half-half by the employer and the Social Security.  In the COVID-19 context, when workers have to take a sick leave because of mandatory quarantine decided by the Portuguese health authorities or sickness with COVID-19 (but not other types of illness), social security pays the sickness benefit from the first day of the sick leave (while usually, there is a waiting period of 3 days for the employees and of 10 to up to 30 days for the self-employed) and for a duration up to 14 days.	The 14-day prophylactic isolation status is now treated as an illness for the purposes of social protection measures. In this case, workers in the private and public sectors are guaranteed the payment of sickness benefits from the Portuguese social security, allowing them to receive 100% of their net monthly pay (minimum limit of 65% of gross reference pay), with no waiting period and for a maximum duration of 14 days (duration of quarantine/isolation).	Parents with children under age 12 who are not able to work due to school or child care closures are entitled to paid leave, paid at two-thirds of earnings up to a ceiling. Paid in equal parts by the employer and social insurance. Self-employed workers in similar circumstances receive an allowance worth one-third of their usual earnings.  Workers caring for a child (or granchild) in quaratine are entitled to up to 14 days paid leave, paid by public social insurance at 100% of earnings for a child, and 65% of earnings for a grandchild.	€438 for 6 months to self-employed workers.   Minimum support: Dependent employees cannot receive less than the statutory minimum wage with this measure (635€ - the RMMG). If so, SS tops-up. Independent/self-employed workers cannot receive less than 438.81€ (a value known as IAS, used to calculate basic income social protection).  Extraordinary extension of unemployment benefits and all benefits of the Social Security system which lasts until the end of containment measures.	“Temporary lay-off scheme” for firms with activity severely affected by the pandemic: - Without training involved: Workers will receive 2/3 of their gross income, up to 1905 euros per month. Firms pay 30% of that sum, social security pays the remaining 70%. This can last up to 6 months maximum. - With training: If firms wish so, instead of temporarily sending workers home and paying the 30% mentioned above, they can take advantage of the current period of reduced activity to reskill or upskill their employees. In this case, the IEFP (the national public institute for professional qualification) will pay 50% of the gross income of their employees up to the RMMG (the national Minimum Guaranteed Monthly Income, which is 635 euros per month from the 1st Jan 2020 - see link above). The firm will still have to pay the remaining 50%. This is a more advantageous training support scheme than usually. 	- Postponing the payments of social security contributions and taxes, granting guaranteed treasury loans of 400 million EUR for SMEs, 60 million for micro enterprises in the tourism sector and encouraging the use of short-time work schemes (by shortening procedures and a higher public coverage of firms' costs). - Flexible tax payments for companies and the self-employed from Q2 2020 onwards, regarding VAT payments, PIT and CIT which looks as follows: 1) payment in three instalments with no late payment interest being charged; or 2) payment in six instalments with late payment interest being due only over the last three instalments.

The VAT is applicable to self-employed workers and companies with turnover up to €10M in 2018 or starting on January 1, 2019, companies and SMEs having closed by decision of the Health Authority, and companies and SMEs whose turnover decreases more than 20% - For self-employed and companies with a turnover of up to EUR 10 million in fiscal year 2018 or that have started the activity after 1 January 2019, it will be possible to defer the withholding tax payment. - Extraordinary support to maintain jobs after the end of lay-off. Companies that are closed or whose activity is reduced by the Health authorities are exempt from social security contributions, as well as on the first month after the resumption of activity. Reduction of social contributions on Q2 2020 to 1/3; deferral of remainder 2/3 to Q3 2020 (fractional payments) for firms with up to 50 employees. Larger companies are eligible if they have seen a drop in turnover of 20% or more and operating in tourism sector, civil aviation or others closed to the public. - Suspension of tax or contributory enforcement proceedings for 3 months - 3.7 billion state-backed credit guarantees are provided by firms in total out of which: - €400 million are direct state guaranteed credit support to companies that are most affected (increased from initially €200 million) and for microenterprises in the tourism sector (€60 million). - state guaranteed credit through the banking system: for restaurants (€600 million, €270 million for SMEs), tourism (€200 million, €75 million for SME), tourism accommodation (€900 million, €300 million for SME), industry (€ 1.300 million, €400 million for SME), fishing and aquiculture sectors (€20 million). - Increased ceilings for export credit insurance schemes for metallurgic, mould, metal and mechanical industries (€100 million), construction abroad (€100 million), short-term exports (€50 million).  - Suspension of termination of rental contracts and possible moratorium in case of income loss. - Suspension of termination of essential services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecom).\		Households may temporarily postpone mortgage payments to 30 September 2020 without consequences.

ESP		June 24, 2020		40.617	-3.388	Spain	Strict confinement, schools and university are closed, travel restrictions, bann on large gatherings, lock down in effect. On March the 29th the confinement’s scope was enlarged including now all non-essential economic activities (this has been partially lifted since April 9th). On April 28 the Council of Ministers approved the "Plan for the transition towards a new normality", with the aim of gradually restoring the development of economic and work activities. This Plan will be progressive (divided into four phases, each lasting at least two weeks, starting on 4 May), asymmetrical (developed at provincial level depending on the fulfilment of objective health, mobility and economic parameters and indicators) and coordinated (under the direction of the Government and the Ministry of Health).	Companies should encourage the implementation of teleworking whenever the activity of the company allows it. To this end, ongoing public programmes have been expedited to support the digitisation of small and medium-sized enterprises. For those sectors still working, the health and safety responsible authorities (Instituto Nacional de Seguridad y Salud en el Trabajo) has published updated guidelines on specifics orientations and the use of individual protection equipment. These measures have been extended for two months (measure adopted on April 21st).  Improved protection for workers under precautionary confinement and/or suffering from COVID-19: workers and civil servants under precautionary confinement or affected by coronavirus will benefit from the regime applicable to leave due to workplace accidents instead of leave due to a regular sickness. The public sector will cover the cost of the leave of these workers.  	Periods of isolation or contagion of workers as a consequence of the COVID-19 virus will be considered as a situation assimilated to a work accident. This enables private-sector workers and self-employed subject to isolation measures to perceive the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system during the period of isolation, which is 75% of their social security regulatory base (compared to 60% for workers on sick leave with a common illness) and to do so from the first day of leave.  Public employees & civil servants are guaranteed 100% pay in the event of sick leave related to the COVID-19 (infection or isolation) or in cases where staff are required to stay home to take care of ill and/or dependant relatives.	Temporary absences from work due to periods of isolation or contagion of the workers will be assimilated to work accidents. This enables workers and self-employed to perceive the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system during the period of illness or isolation: 75% of the social security regulatory base (compared to 60% for workers on sick leave with a common illness). This measure has been extended to workers framed in Special Regimes of the Public Sector. Following the suspension of all non-essential economic activities adopted on March 29, a paid leave was granted between 30 March and 9 April for workers of non-essential activities that cannot be carried out by teleworking. The non-worked days will be compensated with extra working time before 31 December under the terms agreed in collective agreements.	Workers affected by school closures and/or that need to provide care for dependents (including partners and elderly relatives) are entitled to adapt their working locations and hours as needed. These includes stopping working if necessary. This measure has been extended until three months after the end of the state of emergency.  Public employees and civil servants are entitled to 100% pay if they have to stay home to take care of ill and/or dependant relatives and when teleworking is not possible.  Support to families in vulnerable positions: 600 million euros for funding social services programs: home care services and distance caregiving for dependents, both elderly, and people with disability; support and care services for homeless people; funds for minimum income schemes; caregiver assistance for families (especially, for single-parent families); social workers hiring; means for health prevention; and other relevant social services.  25 million euros to provide food to children affected by school closures to combat child poverty. Additional budgetary funds of EUR 300 million to ensure the provision of assistance to dependent persons	Automatic prorogation of unemployment benefits during the health crisis. Suspension of rules concerning minimum contribution periods for unemployment benefits during the crisis, including for temporary workers. The suspension of the rules also include workers whose contracts under trial period have been terminated since March 9th, and for those workers who voluntarily terminated their contract since March 1st because they had a firm job offer that has been withdrawn. Unemployment eligibility is also extended to include permanent discontinuous contracts not qualifying for unemployment benefits unable to resume work as a result of COVID-19.  Six month moratorium on taxes for self-employed.  Extraordinary allowance for self-employed workers, affected by the suspension of economic activity, and deferral of their March social security contribution without charges. New extraordinary economic benefit financed by the Social Security System to compensate self-employed workers. Own-account self-employed who have a turnover fall of at least 75% of that of the previous semester can access the same subsidy for end of activity as those closing their business, even if they complete the minimum contribution period. A three-month credit moratorium on the payment of credits and non-mortgage loans by vulnerable groups. A temporary extraordinary unemployment benefit has been established for domestic employees in the event of lack of activity, reduction of hors worked or termination of the contract. The amount of the subsidy will be 70% of the Social Security "regulatory base" with a max. of 950 euros.  An exceptional subsidy is introduced for workers with a temporary contract of at least two months, when their work contract expires and they do not have the minimum period required to access ordinary unemployment benefits. This allowance, of 430 euros, will last for one month and can be extended.                                                                      Contracts for temporary teaching staff at university that are due to end during the State of Alarm are extended, as well as research contracts financed by grants of the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation. These extensions will be equivalent to the duration of the State of Alarm and, exceptionally may be can be extended up to 3 months after the end of the State of Alarm. During the State of Alarm and until June 30th, it is possible to combine unemployment benefits with temporary employment in agriculture. This measure applies to unemployed people, workers under a temporary suspension of contract, migrant workers whose work permit ends between June 15th and June 30th of 2020, and young people (between 18 and 21 years old) non-Spanish citizens legal residents in Spain.  Reduction of Social Security contributions for certain agricultural workers during periods of inactivity in 2020 and simplification of the procedure for deferring Social Security debt.  Workers affected by the suspension of all non-essential economic activities from March 30th until April 9th will receive their full salary, and will be required to compensate the lost working hours before December 31, 2020.	Changes in the temporary employment adjustment schemes (ERTEs - Expedientes de Regulación Temporal de Empleo): simplification of the scheme (duration of procedures reduced from 15 to 7 days); extension of the access conditions (all workers affected by employment suspension or working time reduction, regardless of contribution period); unemployment benefits received under the temporary employment adjustment scheme do not count in terms of consumption of unemployment benefit rights; exemption of social contributions during the period (100% for SMEs, 75% for the other firms) ; ERTEs have been extended to be applicable in sectors considered essential but having nevertheless suffered a reduction in revenues due to confinement measures. All temporary employment adjustments process related to the Covid-19 crisis are covered under these provisions, even if they were initiated before the approval of the measure.     Extension of social security bonuses in discontinuous fixed contracts to cover contracts from February to June 2020 in the tourism sector, in order to preserve employment.   The Social Agreement for the Defence of Employment, holds different measures aimed at protecting employment beyond the the state alarm. The most important are the following:  - The measures of the ERTES due to force majeure (which exempted employers from paying social security contributions and improved access to unemployment protection) are disassociated from the state of alarm and extended until June 30 (date that may be expanded if the activity restrictions for health reasons are maintained). The 100% exemption of employer contributions to Social Security is maintained for companies that continue in an ERTE of "total force majeure" (when the pandemic continues to prevent the resumption of activity), exemption that is maintained at 75% for companies with 50 or more workers. A new category of ERTEs is introduced for companies that can restart their activity, called "partial force majeure". Companies will be able to combine workers in activity and workers with their employment contract suspended, establishing reductions in social security contributions for all of them. As an incentive for the return to work, the exemptions will be greater for those workers who return to the activity than for those who continue with the suspended contract: For companies with less than 50 workers, the reduction in contributions for workers who return to work will be 85% in May contributions and 70% in June; for workers who continue with the suspended contract, the reduction will be 60% in May contributions and 45% in June. In the case of companies with 50 or more workers, the reduction in contributions for workers who recover their activity will be 60% in the May contributions and 45% in June; for workers who continue with the suspended contract, the reduction will be 45% in May and 30% in June. - The companies that benefit from these exemptions or quota reductions must maintain jobs during the six months following the activity recovery, even if this return is partial or concerns only part of the workforce. This will not apply to companies where there is a risk of insolvency proceedings. - Companies with their tax domicile in offshore locations will not be eligible for the extension of the ERTE due to force majeure. - Companies benefiting from the extension of ERTEs due to force majeure will not be able to distribute dividends during the tax year corresponding to the application of the ERTEs, unless they return the part relating to the exemption applied to social security contributions.	Six month moratorium on taxes for SMEs (1.2 billion from the existing loan guarantee scheme). Companies that have received loans from the General Secretariat for Industry and Small and Medium Enterprises are allowed to postpone their repayment.  Measures to align tax bases to the current situation, (EUR 1.1 billion in liquidity for firms): adjustment to real income received for VAT and income tax by self-employed workers; adjustment of advance corporate tax payments to the estimated revenues in 2020;  suspension of enforcement periods for payment of certain tax debts if companies are financing their payment through the State Guarantee Line; VAT rate is 0 for firms in supply of healthcare material by national producers to public entities, non-profit organizations and hospitals; VAT rate on electronic books, magazines and newspapers is also adjusted to align it with paper products.  The government announced the mobilisation of 200 billion euros (20% of GDP), of which 117 billion will be public (100 billion for guarantees and 17 billion to help those affected by the crisis) and the rest will be based on private sources. On April 21st, the Official Credit Institute (ICO) State Guarantee Line was extended to cover Alternative Fixed-Income Market (MARF) commercial paper.  Moreover a 2 billion euros specific line of guarantees will be allocated for export companies. ICO funding in increase by EUR 10 billion to extend its existing lines of credit to companies and self-employed workers. Additional EUR 60 million of guarantees for CERSA (Compañía Española de Reafinanzamiento). A specific financing line is available through the ICO for the amount of 400 million euros to meet the liquidity needs of companies and self-employed workers in the tourism sector, as well as related activities that are being affected by the current situation. Extension of the moratorium on mortgage payments (announced on March 17 for vulnerable groups) to offices/commercial premises of the self-employed impacted by the crisis, and from 1 month to 3 months. Extension until May 20th of the April deadline for tax filings by SMEs and self-employed workers. Suspension of interest and loan payments for entrepreneurs in the tourism industry for one year. Affected SMEs will be granted deferrals of their tax debts with the Administration during a six month period, without interest. This will allow 14 billion euros of liquidity to be injected into the economic system. Additionally, companies and self-employed with no social security debts are allowed to defer Social Security debt payments due between April and June 2020 with 0.5% interest. Deferral of the reimbursement of principal and/or interest of loans received from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism if COVID-19 has caused disruptions to the beneficiary firm. Flexibility in procedures for accessing and repaying loans or aid from the Ministry of industry was enhanced on March 31st. Mechanism for reducing the costs of renegotiating and deferring rent payments for businesses to large owners or public companies. For other owners, deposits will be facilitaded as payment mechanism. The Social Security authority is authorized to exceptionally grant six-month deferrals on social security contributions. Procedural and administrative requirements for companies are facilitated, and deadlines for insolvency declarations as well as for tax filing procedures and requirements are also extended. 	Economic dismissals related to Covid-19 are not allowed. Companies have to use ERTEs (see column I). Moreover, if a company reduces activity for reasons related to the Covid crisis, the maximum duration of the affected fixed-term contracts can be prolonged for the same number of months of the crisis. During these periods of temporary suspension of employment contracts, companies must not pay social security contributions. This exemption from payment of contributions will be 100% in companies with up to 50 employees or 75% in companies with more than 50 employees.	Evictions: Prohibit evictions due to missed payments for all households until state of emergency lifted. Thereafter, evictions due to missed payments will be prohibited for a maximum of 6 months. (Vulnerable households are those affected by the Temporary Adjustment of Employment Process) or whose incomes have fallen by more than 40% due to COVID-19) Rental contracts: Contracts that are about to expire can be automatically extended for up to 6 months under the same terms. Rental payments: Measures depend on the type of landlord: - If landlord is a company, public housing entity or the owner of 10 or more properties: compulsory automatic moratorium on rent payments for vulnerable households for 4 months, with rental payments due over 3 year period; or a reduction of rent by 50% for 4 months. - For small-scale landlords: rent deferrals are promoted, via agreement; in absence of agreement, vulnerable households are eligible for a microcredit scheme at 0% interest for 6-months, payable over up to 10 years, backed by government guarantee; a new housing allowance programme has been created (see below). Mortgage moratorium for 6 months on an eligible household's permanent home: eligible households include vulnerable households, as well as self-employed, businessmen and professionals whose economic activity has been affected by COVID-19, and landlords who have not received rental payments and are thus unable to cover their mortgage payments.  Utility companies cannot cut services (water, gas, energy) in case of non-payment. A social benefit to cover the costs of energy provision has been extended to households affected by COVID-19. [In coordination with regional authorities] Introduction of a national housing allowance programme to help tenants cover rental payments (or to repay the microcredit for rental payments, mentioned above). Subsidy is a maximum on EUR 900/month for 6 months, or EUR 5 400 if tenant has to repay microcredit.  [In coordination with regional authorities] Reinforcements to support programmes for victims of gender violence, evicted households, the homeless and other vulnerable people. The subsidy is maximum EUR 900/month and EUR 200/month for maintenance, community and supply costs.  Support to regions and municipalities to acquire dwellings to be rented out.  Suspension of non-urgent construction on residential buildings (with some exceptions)	https://www.mscbs.gob.es/en/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/home.htm; http://prensa.mitramiss.gob.es/WebPrensa/noticias/laboral/detalle/3748
SWE		June 24, 2020		65.903	18.572	Sweden	Secondary schools and universities closed. The health authority recommends isolating people over 70 and working from home as much as possible.  Events with more than 50 persons have been banned since 27 March.	Teleworking encouraged as far as possible. 	Central government assumes the entire cost of all sick pay between April and the end of July.   The qualifying day for sick pay will be discontinued between 11 March and 30 September, i.e. the central government will pay sickness benefits for the first day of sickness. From 1 June onwards, the standard compensation will be increased by SEK 104. Suspension of medical certificate requirement for the first 14 days of sickness until 30 September. Self-employed persons will also be compensated in that they can receive standardised sick pay for days 1–14 until 30 September. Health-care workers who have been infected by COVID-19 while performing their duties are entitled to a compensation for work-related injury.	A worker unable to perform work due to being quarantined will be entitled to state disease carrier allowance from Försäkringskassan (as per applicable statutory rules on compensation). These workers will receive approximately 80 percent of their regular salary, capped to SEK 804 per day for up to 14 days (duration of quarantine). Also applies to self-employed workers. However, workers must submit a medical certificate to prove that they are suspected of being infected by COVID-19 or have a risk of carrying the disease (does not apply to people in risk groups). 	Normally, if a worker's child is ill or is a disease carrier, the worker is entitled to parental paid leave (benefit for the care of closely related persons) if he/she needs to be at home to care for his/her child and cannot work from home (providing a medical certification that the child is sick and contagious). However, under the Parental Leave Act, the worker is not eligible for a paid leave due to the care of a sick child if he/she keeps the child at home to protect him from being infected by others. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the government has proposed temporary legislation (as of 25/04) for workers who need to stay home to look after their (healthy) children because of school/preschool closures and cannot work from home; sick-child allowance for parents has been extended to cover the eventuality of school closure due to COVID-19, with a compensation of around 90 percent of their salary.	Temporary reinforcement of unemployment insurance: the funds for the Employment Service to manage newly registered unemployed and notice have been increased as well as those for the unemployment insurance funds to manage notices; the membership terms for joining an unemployment insurance fund have been shortened from 12 to 3 months; the ceiling in the unemployment insurance fund is raised temporarily from SEK 910 to SEK 1 200 per day for the first 100 compensation days; from day 101 onwards, the ceiling for income-related benefits from unemployment insurance funds is proposed to rise from SEK 760 to SEK 1 000 per day between 29 June 2020 and 3 January 2021. The ceiling for basic insurance is temporarily raised from SEK 365 to SEK 510 per day; the waiting period of 6 days before receiving unemployment benefits has been abolished.  Self-employed will received a reduction of individual contributions as that proposed for firms. Self-employed will also be able to defer their VAT payments that otherwise should be paid during the spring, such as on 12 May.   	Employers’ wage costs can be halved and the central government will cover a larger share of the costs. This model is similar to short-time work, but the subsidy level is significantly increased. Moreovor, from 1 May 2020 and for three months, employers will be able to reduce their employees’ working hours by up to 80% (instead of 60%) and the government will bear most of the cost. The wage costs will be reduced by over 70% (previously 50%), while workers will retain almost 90% of their original wage. Combined with the reduced employers’ social security contributions, employer costs can be reduced by up to 86% per cent during May and June. Control mechanisms will be enhanced. Wage negotiations have been postponed to the Autumn.  The period during which a person may have a subsidised job (extra job, new start job or introductory job) will be extended by an additional year for those who already have such jobs; the maximum time for support for starting a business will be extended from six to twelve months; municipalities will receive grants for more summer jobs for young people and funding for green jobs.   From 1 August until 30 September, the central government will compensate employers for higher sick pay costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government is currently preparing the details of the proposal.	A central government loan guarantee has been proposed to make it easier for companies to access financing. The proposal means that the central government will guarantee 70 per cent of new loans banks provide to companies (primarily SMEs) that are experiencing financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 virus but that are otherwise robust.  Almi Företagspartner AB (a state agency which offers loans to companies with growth potential and assists in their business development) will receive a capital contribution of SEK 3 billion to increase its lending to small- and medium-sized businesses throughout the country.  The Swedish Export Credit Agency's loan limit is extended to SEK 200bn (about EUR 18bn, 3.8% of GDP) from SEK 125bn. The ceiling for credit guarantees from the agency which insures export companies and banks against the risk of non-payment in export transactions (EKN) is increased to SEK 500bn (about EUR 45bn, 9.6% of GDP) from SEK 450bn, the same amount as during the 2008 financial crisis.  The cultural sector and sports movement will receive an extra SEK 1 billion in support.  The Government proposes that airlines be able to receive credit guarantees in 2020 amounting to a maximum of SEK 5 billion, of which SEK 1.5 billion is intended for SAS. A temporary reduction of employers’ social security contributions will be proposed for the period 1 March to 30 June 2020 so that only the old age pension contribution is paid (up to 30 employees and on that portion of the employee’s wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month). Support to facilitate and speed up renegotiation of rents. Small enterprises: 100% of the taxable profits of sole proprietors and partners in Swedish partnerships for 2019, up to SEK 1 million, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. VAT reported by sole proprietors annually from 27 December 2019 to 17 January 2021 will be eligible to deferral, with interest. Temporary discount for rental costs in vulnerable sectors (restaurants etc): central government will cover 50 per cent of the rental reduction, up to 50 per cent of the fixed rent. Support to businesses based on loss of turnover (measure currently being prepared): businesses with a turnover of at least SEK 250000 during the past financial year and a loss of turnover of at least 30 per cent will be able to file for support (between 22.5 and 75 per cent of the business’s fixed costs excluding wage costs, depending on loss of turnover in March and April 2020). The maximum amount will be set at SEK 150 million per business.			https://www.government.se/government-policy/the-governments-work-in-response-to-the-virus-responsible-for-covid-19/ https://www.fi.se/en/published/press-releases/2020/loss-of-income-due-to-corona-virus-disease-a-cause-for-exemption-from-amortisation/

If five or fewer people meet, they must maintain a distance of two metres from one another. All establishments open to the public will be closed, except establishments such as food stores and other shops selling articles for everyday use (e.g. kiosks and petrol station shops), takeaway establishments, staff canteens, meal delivery services, pharmacies or banks. From 27 April, hospitals will then be able to resume all medical procedures, and medical practices, hairdressers, massage practices, cosmetic studios, DIY stores, garden centres and florists will be able to reopen.If the situation allows, schools for children of compulsory school age will be allowed to reopen on 11 May. Entry restrictions for all persons (except from Liechtenstein). Exceptions are possible, for example for people who live or work in Switzerland. Anyone wishing to enter Switzerland despite the entry ban must prove that one of the exceptional conditions is met. This arrangement will apply for a maximum of 6 months.	Hygiene regulations for companies, recommendations for home office. Employers in construction and industry are obliged to comply with the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health regarding hygiene and social distance. For this purpose, the number of persons present on construction sites or in companies must be limited accordingly. People at high risk should work from home. If that is not possible, they are to be placed on leave by their employers, but will continue to be paid by their employer.	COVID-19 is recognised as an occupational disease for workers having an activity presenting a hightened risk, such as medical personnel. Other workers with some risk, but more limited (for exemple vendors) are not concerned. SUVA (the Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund) can pay a daily allowance for accident or occupational disease to an infected worker if the COVID-19 infection has been proven and recognised as an occupational disease.	“Corona-Erwerbsersatz Quarantäne”: Persons who are in quarantine and have to interrupt their employment are entitled to compensation if, at the time of the interruption, they are compulsorily insured with the old age provision (i.e. live in Switzerland or are gainfully employed in Switzerland); and are engaged in an employed or self-employed activity. Compensation of 80% of average income up to a maximum daily ceiling of CHF 196 per day, provided with no waiting period and for 10 working days for employees and 30 working days for the self-employed (payments ended on 16 May 2020 for the self-employed able to reopen their business). 	“Corona-Erwerbsersatz Eltern”: Parents with children under 12 years of age who have to interrupt their employment because of school or child care facility closures due to the COVID-19 epidemic are entitled to paid leave. Available for: (1) workers with children under 12 years of age; (2) parents with minors who are entitled to an intensive care supplement; (3) parents of children up to the age of 20 years if they attend a special school. Paid at 80% of earnings, up to a ceiling of CHF 196 per day, with a 3-day waiting period. This applies both to employees and self-employed workers (30-day limit for the self-employed). The entitlement will end once schools/child care facilities re-open for employees. Financed by public social insurance.	• Unemployed persons are covered by compulsory unemployment insurance. The submission of proof of job search efforts is waived. All persons entitled to benefits receive a maximum of 120 additional daily allowances.  • Entitlement to short-time work was extended: Employees in fixed-term employment, apprentices, temporary workers, workers on call and employer-like employees (members of management, business owners, etc.)  as well as their spouses who work for them, are entitled to SWC. Persons in an employer-like position as well as spouses are entitled to a lump sum of CHF 3,320. Furthermore, the Federal Council has suspended the companies' co-payment for recourse to short-time work compensation. • Self-employed persons: If they suffer a loss of income due to the closure of a business or the ban on events ordered under federal law (i.e. are directly affected), they are entitled to compensation amounting to 80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day.  • All other self-employed persons who are only indirectly affected by the measures to protect against the corona pandemic, but who nevertheless suffer a loss of earnings, are entitled to compensation (80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day) if their income is at least CHF 10,000 per year, but does not exceed CHF 90,000 per year (hardship rule). (decision by Federal Council of 16 April. Entry into force retroactively) • Further measures for persons in the cultural sector (hardship payments).	The administrative procedures to apply for short-time work (part-time unemployment benefit) have been eased at short notice: i) the waiting period to benefit from this indemnity is eliminated until September 30, 2020 (against 2 days previously, the first days being borne by the company); ii) Employees no longer have to reduce their overtime before they can benefit from short-time compensation. iii)The approval period for short-time work is extended from 3 to 6 months. This will allow the number of applications to be minimised and thus speed up the approval procedure. In addition, urgent simplifications have been made in the area of processing applications and payments for short-time work with the adoption of new provisions. Short-time work compensation can now also be paid to employees on fixed-term contracts and to persons working for a temporary work organisation. Furthermore, short-time work compensation is accessible for employer-like employees (for example, shareholders of a limited liability company who work as salaried employees in the company), persons who work in the business of the spouse or registered partner as well as apprenticees, too.	CHF40 billion for a liquidity aid. Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation, and will be paid out quickly and with the minimum of bureaucracy. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. Further liquidity measures: Businesses should have the possibility to extend payment deadlines without having to pay default interest. For this reason, the interest rate for VAT, customs duties, special excise taxes and incentive taxes will be reduced to 0.0 percent in the period from 21 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. No interest will be charged during this period. Social insurance contributions: Companies affected by the crisis may be granted a temporary, interest-free deferral of payment of social security contributions. Companies also have the option of having the amount of the regular contributions adjusted if the sum of their wages has fallen significantly. The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.   			https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/massnahmen-des-bundes.html; https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/fr/home.html; https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/fr/home/Arbeit/neues_coronavirus.html

The entitlment covers employees of some public employers and most private employers with fewer than 500 employees. Some employers with fewer than 50 employees can ask for an exemption on business grounds. Workers taking leave are paid by their employers, who can then claim reimbursement from the state through a refundable tax credit. Equivalent credit amounts are available to self-employed individuals under similar circumstances. Workers in some states may have additional entitlements. 	Additional resources have been devoted to providing food for households with low income. Money was also targeted to support the expected increase of unemployment insurance, which is administered by the states. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act also increases Medicaid payments to states.  Unemployment insurance payments increased by $600 per week as well as a direct payment of $1200 for each adult and $500 for children for all US residents with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 ($150,000 married).
