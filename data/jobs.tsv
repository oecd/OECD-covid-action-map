FIN		May 12, 2020		62.716	26.192	Finland	Schools are closed (current ban of in-person instruction until 13 May, the school year ends end of May); travel bans in and out of the Uusima region are lifted, but non-essential travel in Finland continues to be discouraged; public events and gatherings of more than 500 people should continue to be banned until at least 31 July; all cafes and restaurants are closed except for take-away services until the end of May.	Teleworking encouraged when possible since 12th of March 	If the employer is on sick leave because of the coronavirus infection (incapacity to work due to illness), his or her right to sick pay is determined on the basis of the Employment Contracts Act and collective agreements. Payment of salaries during sick leave is included in sectoral collective agreements.   It is recommended that the employee's own statement is sufficient to justify the sick-leave pay.	Sickness allowance on account of an infectious disease to cover loss of income is available only if this has been ordered by the physician responsible for infectious disease control in the relevant municipality or hospital district. No entitlement when i) ordered by employer to stay at home after returning from abroad, ii) need to stay at home because of closure of child care centres or schools, iii) working remotely without loss of income, iv) precautionary quarantine. Temporary financial assistance due to an epidemic outbreak (see column G) can also be paid to persons arriving in Finland from abroad who have been placed in conditions equivalent to quarantine and are therefore forced to take unpaid leave from work. 	Parent employees taking unpaid leave to care for a child who normally would be in early childhood education or school are entitled to a "Temporary financial assistance due to an epidemic outbreak" benefit. The benefit is paid at a flat-rate of  EUR 28.94 per working day (EUR 723.50 per month). The temporary benefit is available until 13 May 2020, when schools and early childhood education facilities are due to re-open. It can be paid retroactively from 16 March 2020. Available to employees only. Paid by public social insurance.  Parents are also entitled to paid sick leave if they cannot work because they need to care for a child under age 16 who has been placed in quarantine. Paid at 100% of earnings. Payment is made through the employer, who is reimbursed by public social insurance. This is available to both employees and the self-employed. 	Temporary recognition of entrepreneurs and freelancers as unemployment benefit recipients until 30 June. Elimination of waiting period for unemployment benefits. Special guidelines to municipalities granting supplementary and preventive social assistance (prioritization of cases totally without other incomes, granting preventive social assistance if there are delays granting basic social assistance in Kela/Social Insurance Institution), municipalities are not recommended to apply reductions of social assistance due to non-compliance (e.g. person refuses to accept a work offer or does not participate in training or certain other activating or integration measures).  The required period of employment for wage-earners will be shortened. Fulfilling the required period of employment is a prerequisite for receiving unemployment allowance. The required period of employment will be 13 calendar weeks instead of the present 26 calendar weeks. For non-owner family members of entrepreneurs the required period of employment will be 26 calendar weeks instead of the present 52 calendar weeks. Unemployment allowances paid on the grounds of layoffs will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum period of payment that applies to the unemployment allowance. This amendment will improve unemployment security should the unemployment be prolonged. The Acts entered into force on 15 April 2020 and will remain in force until 6 July 2020. The amendments will be applied retroactively, starting on 16 March 2020. 	Temporary lay-off procedures (STW) have been fastened to avoid bankruptcies (i.e. the notice period will be shortened from 14 to five days).	Loan guarantees for firms (4% of GDP), most notably via Finnvera, the state’s financing and export credit company. Increase of grants (0.1% of GDP): the public funding agency Business Finland's grant authorisations will be increased to permit immediate business support measures.  The government’s additional budget gives ELY Centres (Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) €400 million in additional resources for funding businesses. The funding is distributed in the form of development assistance.  	Starting from 1 April 2020, employers have the right to lay off an employee in a fixed-term employment relationship under the same conditions as an employee with an employment contract of unspecified duration.

Confinement measures expected to be progressively lifted by areas from 11 May, upon  local sanitary conditions	Teleworking encouraged when possible	Coverage of paid sick-leave (without firm cost-sharing) of workers who will have to stay home to take care of their children		Before 1 May 2020, working parents (employees and the self-employed) with children under age 16 affected by school closure and/or self-isolation were entitled to paid sick leave (paid at 90% of gross earnings for the first 30 days) if no alternative care or work (e.g. teleworking) arrangements could be found. From 1 May 2020, for parent employees, a similar arrangement applies but the parent is placed on the short-time work scheme (see right). Payment under the new scheme equals 70% of gross salary (about 84% of the net salary), and 100% for employees on the minimum wage. Self-employed parents continue to have a right to paid sick leave under the previous scheme. Paid by public social insurance.  Some schools and childcare facilities remain open, with a skeleton staff, to look after children of essential service workers.	Creation of a solidarity fund for small companies. Coverage of very small businesses (turnover < €1M), self-employed workers and micro entrepreneurs experiencing a very sharp drop in turnover (70% loss between March 2020 and March 2019) or subject to administrative closure. Unemployed people will continue receiving their benefits and the confinement period will not be counted in the calculations of unemployment benefit rights (including for the so-called intermittents du spectacle).Temporary agency workers will be paid for the entire duration of their assignment as initially foreseen even if they cannot work because of the confinement measures. People who quit a job for another one but could not be hired for the crisis are granted exceptional access to the unemployment insurance. Craftsmen and retail traders will get a one-off tax-free payment of max 1250 euros (financed by drawing on the supplementary pension scheme for these self-employed workers thanks to an agreement with the employers' association).	Extension of short-time work schemes (including domestic work) through higher coverage of workers’ payments (100% at the minimum wage and 84% of higher gross wages  up to a maximum of 4.5 SMIC) and the absence of cost sharing for firms and granting companies a period of thirty days to file their request, with retroactive effect; solidarity fund will cover up to 80% of their net income. Some derogations to maximum working hours to allow essential services to work more hours if need be. Companies may also impose annual leave to all employees.

DEU		May 12, 2020		51.394	9.657	Germany	Schools and universities are closed, travel restrictions, non-essential shops and public spaces are closed, ban on large gatherings.   Deconfinement: Smaller stores below 800 m2, car dealerships, book and bike shops were allowed to re-open from the week of April 20. Schools will gradually start to open from 4 May. Bars, cafés, restaurants and cinemas remain closed and large public gatherings are banned until 31 August.	Teleworking encouraged when possible		Employees will continue to receive a salary and employers will be reimbursed by the Federal Government. The wages are also paid in quarantine, where the Infection Protection Act applies with continued wages, which the employer can then get from the health department. The self-employed also have the right to an income replacement from the health authority if there is a concrete and certified suspicion of infection. 	Working parents with children under age 12 who are not able to work due to school or child care closures are entitled to six weeks paid leave, paid at 67% of earnings up to ceiling (EUR 2016 per month). The leave is paid by the employer, who then claims compensation from the relevant state authority.   In addition, the government has simplified the application process for the child supplement -- a means-tested in-work benefit.  Some schools and childcare facilities remain open, with a skeleton staff, to look after children of essential service workers. 	Self-employed persons and freelancers will receive compensation for loss of earnings based on the profits established in the tax declaration of the previous calendar year.  The ruling coalition agreed to extend the maximum unemployment benefit duration by three months for all claimants whose entitlements end between 1 Mai and 31 December. 	Previously, companies could apply for Kurzarbeit when 30% of their employees are affected by drop in orders due to economic developments. This has now been lowered to 10% of employees. Partial or complete waiver of the need to build up a negative balance in working hours. Reduced hours compensation benefit will also be available to temporary/agency workers. Complete reimbursement of social security contributions by the Federal Labour Office. On April 22, the government announced to increase replacement rates for lost earnings in the short-time work scheme. Payments will increase from 60 % to 70% for childless workers and from 67% to 77% for workers with children from the fourth month of short-time work onwards if they have reduced their working time by at least 50%. In the seventh month, payments are increased further to 80% and 87% respectively.	The German government will protect businesses with new measures to provide liquidity, the volume of which is unlimited. Due to the high degree of uncertainty in the current situation, the government has very deliberately decided to not set any limits on the volume of these measures. This is a very significant decision which is supported by the entire federal government. Germany authorized its state bank (a bank run by the government, but not a central bank), KfW, to lend out as much as $610 billion to companies to cushion the effects of the coronavirus. April 6th: immediate-loan scheme through the KfW with 100% government risk assumption and without a firm’s risk assessment. To support the recovery of restaurants, the reduced VAT rate of 7% will be applied to this sector for 12 months starting on July 1. This does not, however, necessarily imply that restaurants will open again in July. SMEs will be able to carry back their 2020 tax losses against advance tax payments from the previous year. 		As of April 1st, missed rent payments due to COVID-related reasons cannot lead to evictions and rent payments for these tenants will be postponed (in force 1st of April to 30th of June). Rents need to be paid in full afterwards (by 30th of June 2022) to ensure no losses for landlords. Consumers that cannot finance running consumption costs for their housing units (such as electricity, gas, telecommunication and water) can postpone them without being charged late payment fees or forced to judicial debt collection.	https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.html https://www.bmas.de/DE/Presse/Meldungen/2020/corona-virus-arbeitsrechtliche-auswirkungen.htm

Families with children under 18 will receive a one-off child benefit payment on 1 June 2020 worth ISK 30 000 or ISK 42 000 per child, depending on income.	Reduced Employment ratio:  payment of unemployment benefits up to 75% of salary for short-term workers or unemployed. The self-employed and freelancers are also eligible for this benefit. Wages paid alongside reduced unemployment ratio do not deplete unemployment benefits (between March 15th and June 1st  2020).

Reduced Employment ratio: workers who see their working hours reduced are entitled to the payment of unemployment benefits. The new provisions are valid from March 15th until June 1st  2020. The measure is intended to encourage employers to maintain employment relationships instead of using layoffs. It consists of employees and employers making a temporary agreement to reduce employees´ employment ratio. It is then possible to apply for unemployment benefits alongside the reduced employment ratio. The employee’s employment ratio must be reduced by at least 20% and cannot be reduced further down than 25% (Therefore in order for this measure to apply an employee must have been in at least 45% employment before the reducement). This option has been extended to 31 August, with a possible reduction in hours or salary to as low as 25%, or 50% from July onwards. An application must be filed for an extension, and the requirements for participation will be reviewed.

IRL		May 12, 2020		53.214	-7.588	Ireland	Schools are closed, travel restrictions, large gatherings are banned, social distancing measures 	Teleworking encouraged when possible	Rules for Illness Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance will be changed to help prevent the transmission of coronavirus. The changes mean that if a worker is diagnosed with COVID-19, or are suspected of having COVID-19 and are medically required to self-isolate (see right), she can get income support without having to wait for 6 days. She can apply for Enhanced Illness Benefit from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which grants EUR350 per week per person, and is expanded for adults with dependent children. Self-employed can now access the scheme, too. These provisions only apply to private sector workers. The Enhanced Illness Benefit provision is meant to be complemented by the employer sick leave provisions. If this cannot happen, the worker can apply for a Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The means test for Supplementary Welfare Allowance will be removed if a person is medically required to self-isolate or are diagnosed with COVID-19. 	See column E 	No new measures. Workers already had the right to take 3 days force majeure leave in a 12-month period, or 5 days in a 36 month period. You can ask your employer to allow you to take the full 5 days paid force majeure leave together. 	New COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.

Recipients of a number of welfare allowances prior to the crisis can cumulate those with the Unemployment Payment. Self-employed who pay themselves as "Pay As You Earn" can apply for the "Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme"; those who do not can apply to the "COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment". Extra provisions are made for households with numerous children. 	If the employer can show that s/he lost at least 25 percent of business, s/he can apply to a Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme. The COVID-19 Wage Subsidy allows employers to pay their employees during the current pandemic. Employers will be refunded up to 70 percent of an employee's wages - capped at a maximum weekly tax free payment of 410 euros per employee which is equivalent to 70% of the net weekly income for someone on 38,000 euros per annum. A special supplement has been introduced for the particular needs of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sectors.  The Short-time Work Support (STWS) Scheme is an income support payment – a form of Jobseekers Benefit – for employees who have been temporarily placed on a shorter working week. The measure pre-existed the COVID crisis. Short Time Work Support is paid for a maximum of 234 days and conditional on meeting requirements such as previous social insurance contributions, previous full employment, and current reduced employment of 3 days or less per week. Payments range from 81.2 to 391.76 EUR per week.	Deferral to stamp duty. Extensive supports for companies, including SMEs, through a Credit Guarantee Scheme, COVID-19 Business Loans for micro-enterprises, SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme for short-term loans, Future Growth Loan Scheme for long-term loans, and a Sustaining Enterprise Fund for companies with 10 employees or more. Some programs require a business viability assessment, others a criterion of innovation.

ESP		May 22, 2020		40.617	-3.388	Spain	Strict confinement, schools and university are closed, travel restrictions, bann on large gatherings, lock down in effect. On March the 29th the confinement’s scope was enlarged including now all non-essential economic activities (this has been partially lifted since April 9th). On April 28 the Council of Ministers approved the "Plan for the transition towards a new normality", with the aim of gradually restoring the development of economic and work activities. This Plan will be progressive (divided into four phases, each lasting at least two weeks, starting on 4 May), asymmetrical (developed at provincial level depending on the fulfilment of objective health, mobility and economic parameters and indicators) and coordinated (under the direction of the Government and the Ministry of Health).	Companies should encourage the implementation of teleworking whenever the activity of the company allows it. To this end, ongoing public programmes have been expedited to support the digitisation of small and medium-sized enterprises. For those sectors still working, the health and safety responsible authorities (Instituto Nacional de Seguridad y Salud en el Trabajo) has published updated guidelines on specifics orientations and the use of individual protection equipment. These measures have been extended for two months (measure adopted on April 21st).  Improved protection for workers under precautionary confinement and/or suffering from COVID-19: workers and civil servants under precautionary confinement or affected by coronavirus will benefit from the regime applicable to leave due to workplace accidents instead of leave due to a regular sickness. The public sector will cover the cost of the leave of these workers.  	Periods of isolation or contagion of workers as a consequence of the COVID-19 virus will be considered as a situation assimilated to a work accident. This enables workers and self-employed subject to isolation measures to perceive the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system during the period of isolation, which is 75% of their social security regulatory base (compared to 60% for workers on sick leave with a common illness) and to do so from the first day of leave. 	Temporary absences from work due to periods of isolation or contagion of the workers will be assimilated to work accidents. This enables workers and self-employed to perceive the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system during the period of illness or isolation: 75% of the social security regulatory base (compared to 60% for workers on sick leave with a common illness). This measure has been extended to workers framed in Special Regimes of the Public Sector. Following the suspension of all non-essential economic activities adopted on March 29, a paid leave was granted between 30 March and 9 April for workers of non-essential activities that cannot be carried out by teleworking. The non-worked days will be compensated with extra working time before 31 December under the terms agreed in collective agreements.	Workers affected by school closures and/or that need to provide care for dependents (including partners and elderly relatives) are entitled to adapt their working locations and hours as needed. These includes stopping working if necessary. This measure has been extended until three months after the end of the state of emergency.  Support to families in vulnerable positions: 600 million euros for funding social services programs: home care services and distance caregiving for dependents, both elderly, and people with disability; support and care services for homeless people; funds for minimum income schemes; caregiver assistance for families (especially, for single-parent families); social workers hiring; means for health prevention; and other relevant social services.  25 million euros to provide food to children affected by school closures to combat child poverty. Additional budgetary funds of EUR 300 million to ensure the provision of assistance to dependent persons	Automatic prorogation of unemployment benefits during the health crisis. Suspension of rules concerning minimum contribution periods for unemployment benefits during the crisis, including for temporary workers. The suspension of the rules also include workers whose contracts under trial period have been terminated since March 9th, and for those workers who voluntarily terminated their contract since March 1st because they had a firm job offer that has been withdrawn. Unemployment eligibility is also extended to include permanent discontinuous contracts not qualifying for unemployment benefits unable to resume work as a result of COVID-19.  Six month moratorium on taxes for self-employed.  Extraordinary allowance for self-employed workers, affected by the suspension of economic activity, and deferral of their March social security contribution without charges. New extraordinary economic benefit financed by the Social Security System to compensate self-employed workers. Own-account self-employed who have a turnover fall of at least 75% of that of the previous semester can access the same subsidy for end of activity as those closing their business, even if they complete the minimum contribution period. A three-month credit moratorium on the payment of credits and non-mortgage loans by vulnerable groups. A temporary extraordinary unemployment benefit has been established for domestic employees in the event of lack of activity, reduction of hors worked or termination of the contract. The amount of the subsidy will be 70% of the Social Security "regulatory base" with a max. of 950 euros.  An exceptional subsidy is introduced for workers with a temporary contract of at least two months, when their work contract expires and they do not have the minimum period required to access ordinary unemployment benefits. This allowance, of 430 euros, will last for one month and can be extended.                                                                      Contracts for temporary teaching staff at university that are due to end during the State of Alarm are extended, as well as research contracts financed by grants of the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation. These extensions will be equivalent to the duration of the State of Alarm and, exceptionally may be can be extended up to 3 months after the end of the State of Alarm. During the State of Alarm and until June 30th, it is possible to combine unemployment benefits with temporary employment in agriculture. This measure applies to unemployed people, workers under a temporary suspension of contract, migrant workers whose work permit ends between June 15th and June 30th of 2020, and young people (between 18 and 21 years old) non-Spanish citizens legal residents in Spain.  Reduction of Social Security contributions for certain agricultural workers during periods of inactivity in 2020 and simplification of the procedure for deferring Social Security debt.  Workers affected by the suspension of all non-essential economic activities from March 30th until April 9th will receive their full salary, and will be required to compensate the lost working hours before December 31, 2020.	Changes in the temporary employment adjustment schemes (ERTEs - Expedientes de Regulación Temporal de Empleo): simplification of the scheme (duration of procedures reduced from 15 to 7 days); extension of the access conditions (all workers affected by employment suspension or working time reduction, regardless of contribution period); unemployment benefits received under the temporary employment adjustment scheme do not count in terms of consumption of unemployment benefit rights; exemption of social contributions during the period (100% for SMEs, 75% for the other firms) ; ERTEs have been extended to be applicable in sectors considered essential but having nevertheless suffered a reduction in revenues due to confinement measures. All temporary employment adjustments process related to the Covid-19 crisis are covered under these provisions, even if they were initiated before the approval of the measure.     Extension of social security bonuses in discontinuous fixed contracts to cover contracts from February to June 2020 in the tourism sector, in order to preserve employment.   The Social Agreement for the Defence of Employment, holds different measures aimed at protecting employment beyond the the state alarm. The most important are the following:  - The measures of the ERTES due to force majeure (which exempted employers from paying social security contributions and improved access to unemployment protection) are disassociated from the state of alarm and extended until June 30 (date that may be expanded if the activity restrictions for health reasons are maintained). The 100% exemption of employer contributions to Social Security is maintained for companies that continue in an ERTE of "total force majeure" (when the pandemic continues to prevent the resumption of activity), exemption that is maintained at 75% for companies with 50 or more workers. A new category of ERTEs is introduced for companies that can restart their activity, called "partial force majeure". Companies will be able to combine workers in activity and workers with their employment contract suspended, establishing reductions in social security contributions for all of them. As an incentive for the return to work, the exemptions will be greater for those workers who return to the activity than for those who continue with the suspended contract: For companies with less than 50 workers, the reduction in contributions for workers who return to work will be 85% in May contributions and 70% in June; for workers who continue with the suspended contract, the reduction will be 60% in May contributions and 45% in June. In the case of companies with 50 or more workers, the reduction in contributions for workers who recover their activity will be 60% in the May contributions and 45% in June; for workers who continue with the suspended contract, the reduction will be 45% in May and 30% in June. - The companies that benefit from these exemptions or quota reductions must maintain jobs during the six months following the activity recovery, even if this return is partial or concerns only part of the workforce. This will not apply to companies where there is a risk of insolvency proceedings. - Companies with their tax domicile in offshore locations will not be eligible for the extension of the ERTE due to force majeure. - Companies benefiting from the extension of ERTEs due to force majeure will not be able to distribute dividends during the tax year corresponding to the application of the ERTEs, unless they return the part relating to the exemption applied to social security contributions.	Six month moratorium on taxes for SMEs (1.2 billion from the existing loan guarantee scheme). Companies that have received loans from the General Secretariat for Industry and Small and Medium Enterprises are allowed to postpone their repayment.  Measures to align tax bases to the current situation, (EUR 1.1 billion in liquidity for firms): adjustment to real income received for VAT and income tax by self-employed workers; adjustment of advance corporate tax payments to the estimated revenues in 2020;  suspension of enforcement periods for payment of certain tax debts if companies are financing their payment through the State Guarantee Line; VAT rate is 0 for firms in supply of healthcare material by national producers to public entities, non-profit organizations and hospitals; VAT rate on electronic books, magazines and newspapers is also adjusted to align it with paper products.  The government announced the mobilisation of 200 billion euros (20% of GDP), of which 117 billion will be public (100 billion for guarantees and 17 billion to help those affected by the crisis) and the rest will be based on private sources. On April 21st, the Official Credit Institute (ICO) State Guarantee Line was extended to cover Alternative Fixed-Income Market (MARF) commercial paper.  Moreover a 2 billion euros specific line of guarantees will be allocated for export companies. ICO funding in increase by EUR 10 billion to extend its existing lines of credit to companies and self-employed workers. Additional EUR 60 million of guarantees for CERSA (Compañía Española de Reafinanzamiento). A specific financing line is available through the ICO for the amount of 400 million euros to meet the liquidity needs of companies and self-employed workers in the tourism sector, as well as related activities that are being affected by the current situation. Extension of the moratorium on mortgage payments (announced on March 17 for vulnerable groups) to offices/commercial premises of the self-employed impacted by the crisis, and from 1 month to 3 months. Extension until May 20th of the April deadline for tax filings by SMEs and self-employed workers. Suspension of interest and loan payments for entrepreneurs in the tourism industry for one year. Affected SMEs will be granted deferrals of their tax debts with the Administration during a six month period, without interest. This will allow 14 billion euros of liquidity to be injected into the economic system. Additionally, companies and self-employed with no social security debts are allowed to defer Social Security debt payments due between April and June 2020 with 0.5% interest. Deferral of the reimbursement of principal and/or interest of loans received from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism if COVID-19 has caused disruptions to the beneficiary firm. Flexibility in procedures for accessing and repaying loans or aid from the Ministry of industry was enhanced on March 31st. Mechanism for reducing the costs of renegotiating and deferring rent payments for businesses to large owners or public companies. For other owners, deposits will be facilitaded as payment mechanism. The Social Security authority is authorized to exceptionally grant six-month deferrals on social security contributions. Procedural and administrative requirements for companies are facilitated, and deadlines for insolvency declarations as well as for tax filing procedures and requirements are also extended. 	Economic dismissals related to Covid-19 are not allowed. Companies have to use ERTEs (see column I). Moreover, if a company reduces activity for reasons related to the Covid crisis, the maximum duration of the affected fixed-term contracts can be prolonged for the same number of months of the crisis. During these periods of temporary suspension of employment contracts, companies must not pay social security contributions. This exemption from payment of contributions will be 100% in companies with up to 50 employees or 75% in companies with more than 50 employees.	Evictions: Prohibit evictions due to missed payments for all households until state of emergency lifted. Thereafter, evictions due to missed payments will be prohibited for a maximum of 6 months. (Vulnerable households are those affected by the Temporary Adjustment of Employment Process) or whose incomes have fallen by more than 40% due to COVID-19) Rental contracts: Contracts that are about to expire can be automatically extended for up to 6 months under the same terms. Rental payments: Measures depend on the type of landlord: - If landlord is a company, public housing entity or the owner of 10 or more properties: compulsory automatic moratorium on rent payments for vulnerable households for 4 months, with rental payments due over 3 year period; or a reduction of rent by 50% for 4 months. - For small-scale landlords: rent deferrals are promoted, via agreement; in absence of agreement, vulnerable households are eligible for a microcredit scheme at 0% interest for 6-months, payable over up to 10 years, backed by government guarantee; a new housing allowance programme has been created (see below). Mortgage moratorium for 6 months on an eligible household's permanent home: eligible households include vulnerable households, as well as self-employed, businessmen and professionals whose economic activity has been affected by COVID-19, and landlords who have not received rental payments and are thus unable to cover their mortgage payments.  Utility companies cannot cut services (water, gas, energy) in case of non-payment. A social benefit to cover the costs of energy provision has been extended to households affected by COVID-19. [In coordination with regional authorities] Introduction of a national housing allowance programme to help tenants cover rental payments (or to repay the microcredit for rental payments, mentioned above). Subsidy is a maximum on EUR 900/month for 6 months, or EUR 5 400 if tenant has to repay microcredit.  [In coordination with regional authorities] Reinforcements to support programmes for victims of gender violence, evicted households, the homeless and other vulnerable people.

SWE		May 21, 2020		65.903	18.572	Sweden	Secondary schools and universities closed. The health authority recommends isolating people over 70 and working from home as much as possible.  Events with more than 50 persons have been banned since 27 March.	Teleworking encouraged as far as possible. 	Central government assumes the entire cost of all sick pay between April and the end of July.   The qualifying day for sick pay will be discontinued between 11 March and 30 September, i.e. the central government will pay sickness benefits for the first day of sickness.From 1 June onwards, the standard compensation will be increased by SEK 104. Suspension of medical certificate requirement for the first 14 days of sickness until 30 September. Self-employed persons will also be compensated in that they can receive standardised sick pay for days 1–14 until 30 September.			Temporary reinforcement of unemployment insurance: the funds for the Employment Service to manage newly registered unemployed and notice have been increased as well as those for the unemployment insurance funds to manage notices; the membership terms for joining an unemployment insurance fund have been shortened from 12 to 3 months; the ceiling in the unemployment insurance fund is raised temporarily from SEK 910 to SEK 1 200 per day for the first 100 compensation days; from day 101 onwards, the ceiling for income-related benefits from unemployment insurance funds is proposed to rise from SEK 760 to SEK 1 000 per day between 29 June 2020 and 3 January 2021. The ceiling for basic insurance is temporarily raised from SEK 365 to SEK 510 per day; the waiting period of 6 days before receiving unemployment benefits has been abolished.  Self-employed will received a reduction of individual contributions as that proposed for firms. Self-employed will also be able to defer their VAT payments that otherwise should be paid during the spring, such as on 12 May.   	Employers’ wage costs can be halved and the central government will cover a larger share of the costs. This model is similar to short-time work, but the subsidy level is significantly increased. Moreovor, from 1 May 2020 and for three months, employers will be able to reduce their employees’ working hours by up to 80% (instead of 60%) and the government will bear most of the cost. The wage costs will be reduced by over 70% (previously 50%), while workers will retain almost 90% of their original wage. Combined with the reduced employers’ social security contributions, employer costs can be reduced by up to 86% per cent during May and June. Control mechanisms will be enhanced. Wage negotiations have been postponed to the Autumn.  The period during which a person may have a subsidised job (extra job, new start job or introductory job) will be extended by an additional year for those who already have such jobs; the maximum time for support for starting a business will be extended from six to twelve months; municipalities will receive grants for more summer jobs for young people and funding for green jobs.   From 1 August until 30 September, the central government will compensate employers for higher sick pay costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government is currently preparing the details of the proposal.	A central government loan guarantee has been proposed to make it easier for companies to access financing. The proposal means that the central government will guarantee 70 per cent of new loans banks provide to companies (primarily SMEs) that are experiencing financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 virus but that are otherwise robust.  Almi Företagspartner AB (a state agency which offers loans to companies with growth potential and assists in their business development) will receive a capital contribution of SEK 3 billion to increase its lending to small- and medium-sized businesses throughout the country.  The Swedish Export Credit Agency's loan limit is extended to SEK 200bn (about EUR 18bn, 3.8% of GDP) from SEK 125bn. The ceiling for credit guarantees from the agency which insures export companies and banks against the risk of non-payment in export transactions (EKN) is increased to SEK 500bn (about EUR 45bn, 9.6% of GDP) from SEK 450bn, the same amount as during the 2008 financial crisis.  The cultural sector and sports movement will receive an extra SEK 1 billion in support.  The Government proposes that airlines be able to receive credit guarantees in 2020 amounting to a maximum of SEK 5 billion, of which SEK 1.5 billion is intended for SAS. A temporary reduction of employers’ social security contributions will be proposed for the period 1 March to 30 June 2020 so that only the old age pension contribution is paid (up to 30 employees and on that portion of the employee’s wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month). Support to facilitate and speed up renegotiation of rents. Small enterprises: 100% of the taxable profits of sole proprietors and partners in Swedish partnerships for 2019, up to SEK 1 million, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. VAT reported by sole proprietors annually from 27 December 2019 to 17 January 2021 will be eligible to deferral, with interest. Temporary discount for rental costs in vulnerable sectors (restaurants etc): central government will cover 50 per cent of the rental reduction, up to 50 per cent of the fixed rent. Support to businesses based on loss of turnover (measure currently being prepared): businesses with a turnover of at least SEK 250000 during the past financial year and a loss of turnover of at least 30 per cent will be able to file for support (between 22.5 and 75 per cent of the business’s fixed costs excluding wage costs, depending on loss of turnover in March and April 2020). The maximum amount will be set at SEK 150 million per business.			https://www.government.se/government-policy/the-governments-work-in-response-to-the-virus-responsible-for-covid-19/ https://www.fi.se/en/published/press-releases/2020/loss-of-income-due-to-corona-virus-disease-a-cause-for-exemption-from-amortisation/

If five or fewer people meet, they must maintain a distance of two metres from one another. All establishments open to the public will be closed, except establishments such as food stores and other shops selling articles for everyday use (e.g. kiosks and petrol station shops), takeaway establishments, staff canteens, meal delivery services, pharmacies or banks. From 27 April, hospitals will then be able to resume all medical procedures, and medical practices, hairdressers, massage practices, cosmetic studios, DIY stores, garden centres and florists will be able to reopen.If the situation allows, schools for children of compulsory school age will be allowed to reopen on 11 May. Entry restrictions for all persons (except from Liechtenstein). Exceptions are possible, for example for people who live or work in Switzerland. Anyone wishing to enter Switzerland despite the entry ban must prove that one of the exceptional conditions is met. This arrangement will apply for a maximum of 6 months.	Hygiene regulations for companies, recommendations for home office. Employers in construction and industry are obliged to comply with the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health regarding hygiene and social distance. For this purpose, the number of persons present on construction sites or in companies must be limited accordingly. People at high risk should work from home. If that is not possible, they are to be placed on leave by their employers, but will continue to be paid by their employer.		“Corona-Erwerbsersatz Quarantäne”: Persons who are in quarantine and have to interrupt their employment are entitled to compensation if, at the time of the interruption, they are compulsorily insured with the old age provision (i.e. live in Switzerland or are gainfully employed in Switzerland); and are engaged in an employed or self-employed activity. 	“Corona-Erwerbsersatz Eltern”: Parents with children under 12 years of age who have to interrupt their employment because of school or child care facility closures are entitled to paid leave. Paid at 80% of earnings, up to a ceiling of CHF 196 per day. The entitlement will end once schools/child care facilities re-open. This applies both to employees and self-employed workers (30-day limit for the self-employed). Financed by public social insurance.	• Unemployed persons are covered by compulsory unemployment insurance. The submission of proof of job search efforts is waived. All persons entitled to benefits receive a maximum of 120 additional daily allowances.  • Entitlement to short-time work was extended: Employees in fixed-term employment, apprentices, temporary workers, workers on call and employer-like employees (members of management, business owners, etc.)  as well as their spouses who work for them, are entitled to SWC. Persons in an employer-like position as well as spouses are entitled to a lump sum of CHF 3,320. Furthermore, the Federal Council has suspended the companies' co-payment for recourse to short-time work compensation. • Self-employed persons: If they suffer a loss of income due to the closure of a business or the ban on events ordered under federal law (i.e. are directly affected), they are entitled to compensation amounting to 80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day.  • All other self-employed persons who are only indirectly affected by the measures to protect against the corona pandemic, but who nevertheless suffer a loss of earnings, are entitled to compensation (80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day) if their income is at least CHF 10,000 per year, but does not exceed CHF 90,000 per year (hardship rule). (decision by Federal Council of 16 April. Entry into force retroactively) • Further measures for persons in the cultural sector (hardship payments).	The administrative procedures to apply for short-time work (part-time unemployment benefit) have been eased at short notice: i) the waiting period to benefit from this indemnity is eliminated until September 30, 2020 (against 2 days previously, the first days being borne by the company); ii) Employees no longer have to reduce their overtime before they can benefit from short-time compensation. iii)The approval period for short-time work is extended from 3 to 6 months. This will allow the number of applications to be minimised and thus speed up the approval procedure. In addition, urgent simplifications have been made in the area of processing applications and payments for short-time work with the adoption of new provisions. Short-time work compensation can now also be paid to employees on fixed-term contracts and to persons working for a temporary work organisation. Furthermore, short-time work compensation is accessible for employer-like employees (for example, shareholders of a limited liability company who work as salaried employees in the company), persons who work in the business of the spouse or registered partner as well as apprenticees, too.	CHF40 billion for a liquidity aid. Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation, and will be paid out quickly and with the minimum of bureaucracy. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. Further liquidity measures: Businesses should have the possibility to extend payment deadlines without having to pay default interest. For this reason, the interest rate for VAT, customs duties, special excise taxes and incentive taxes will be reduced to 0.0 percent in the period from 21 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. No interest will be charged during this period. Social insurance contributions: Companies affected by the crisis may be granted a temporary, interest-free deferral of payment of social security contributions. Companies also have the option of having the amount of the regular contributions adjusted if the sum of their wages has fallen significantly. The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.   			https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/massnahmen-des-bundes.html; https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/fr/home.html; https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/fr/home/Arbeit/neues_coronavirus.html
