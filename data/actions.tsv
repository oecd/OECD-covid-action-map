AUS	30-Mar-2020	-24.578	133.582	Australia	From 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020, only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days, either at home or in a hotel. Interstate travel is possible, but individual states have introduced a requirement to self isolate for 14 days after arrival. 	Only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All Australians are not allowed to take a return trip overseas, unless in exceptional circumstances. Cruise ships from foreign ports are banned.  <Br/>On 27 March 2020, the Western Australian government imposed restrictions on travel within the state. Western Australians will not be permitted to leave their regional boundary unless under exceptional circumstances (e.g. employment purposes, medical reasons, health and emergency services, people living in border communities, transport of essential goods, compassionate grounds). 	No national blanket closure of schools. Public schools in several sub-national jurisdictions have moved to online-only learning. Private and independent schools exercise discretion on closure and delivery methods.	The government has suspended non-essential gatherings. Essential gatherings are limited to 500 people for outdoor gatherings and 100 people for indoor gatherings. Where possible, people are advised to keep 1.5 metres between themself and others and there should be no more than one person per 4 square metres.<Br/>On 25 March 2020, tighter restrictions were imposed on weddings, funerals, fitness classes, beauty salons, arcades, play centres. Pubs, licensed clubs and hotels (excluding accommodation), places of worship, gyms, indoor sporting venues, cinemas, casinos must close. Takeaway only at restaurants and cafes.<Br/>	The Government has committed an additional $2.4 billion to support the health system to manage any further outbreak in Australia. The package provides support across primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the National Medical Stockpile, along with a national communication campaign. The package also provides funding to ensure Australia has sufficient PPE and medicines in addition to infection control training and programs for health and aged care workers. On 15 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced that health services had moved into the 'Targeted Action' stage of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This included moving resources within hospitals to priority areas, establishing fever clinics which specialise in COVID-19, cancelling elective surgeries to free up capacity in public hospitals and adapting hospital resources (i.e. rooms and equipment) for use in priority areas, such as Intensive Care Units.	In addition to the Commonwealth Governments AUD$64bn package, state governments have also announced their own stimulus packages:<Br/><Br/>* The Victorian government announced a AUD$1.7bn (0.1% of GDP) stimulus that included a fund to provide employment for some dismissed workers, payroll tax refunds for businesses and supports for firms in the worst-affected sectors. <Br/><Br/>* The New South Wales government announced a AUD$1.6bn (0.1% of GDP) package that included payroll tax relief for firms and new capital projects. <Br/><Br/>* The Queensland government have announced a AUD$3.2bn (0.2% of GDP) stimulus including the establishment of a loan facility for impacted businesses and payroll tax relief. <Br/><Br/>* The Western Australian government announced a AUD607mn package (0.03% of GDP) that included a freeze on household fees and charges and payroll tax relief for firms. <Br/><Br/>* The Tasmanian government announced a AUD$839mn (0.04% of GDP) package that included payments to households, interest free loans to small businesses and payroll tax waivers for businesses in sectors most heavily impacted and targeted industry assistance.<Br/><Br/>* The South Australian government announced a $650 million jobs rescue package including a fund to provide employment opportunities, payroll tax relief, land tax relief, a once-off boost of $500 for households who are receiving the welfare support and a waiver of liquor licence fees for 2020-21 for those hotels, restaurants, cafes and clubs forced to close. <Br/><Br/>* The Australian Capital Territory announced a $137 million stimulus package targetting vulnerable households through cash payments and small business through the provision of credit and a fund for contractors to undertake simple works on government assets. <Br/><Br/>* The Northern Territory announced a $115 million stimulus package including payroll tax exemption, grants to businesses and not-for-profit and community organisations and a home improvement scheme. <Br/>	There has been a temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight.  This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. The supplement will be paid for the next six months. Social security and veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders will receive up to two separate cash payments of $750. Those who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive a second cash payment totalling AUD$750. The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. 	New measures include: support for business investment, incl. by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access of this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures; and boost business cash flows (incl. through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). A range of measures have been taken to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring  interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). This is complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits. Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government will guarantee 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility will be AUD$40bn (2% of GDP). Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, small businesses impacted by the coronavirus crisis will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.<Br/>	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent), 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent. On 19 March, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced the introduction of a term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses. The facility will have AUD90bn of capital (4.5% of GDP). It was also announced that Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/>On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	
AUT	30-Mar-2020	47.65	14.705	Austria	Two popular ski regions (Paznauntal, St.Anton/Arlberg) in Tyrol have been under quarantine since March 13, the Gasteinertal, Grossarltal and Flachau (all in the Salzburg region), the rest of Tyrol, parts of Vorlarlberg (Lech, Warth, Schr&ouml;cken, Kl&ouml;sterle, Nenzing-Dorf, Beschling) and Carinthia (Gemeinde Heiligenblut) since March 19.  	The government has restricted access on Austria's external borders for all neighbouring countries besides the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. However, both borders are closed from the respective other side, the Czech Republic restricts commuter traffic. Transit (and freight transport) is still possible. Official air traffic and external train traffic is suspended.	Latest since March 16, all schools are closed.	Austrian authorities have enforced a country-wide curfew since 16 March. As of 10 March, big indoor and outdoor events have been cancelled and the government closed the external border with Italy. On 13 March, authorities announced the closure of schools from 16 March on and closed all shops besides supermarkets, pharmacies and a couple of other essential shops (a full list of businesses still allowed to open is found here). Museums, monuments, restaurants and bars are also closed. All events with more than five people are prohibited. In addition, municipal council elections in Styria and Vorarlberg (initially scheduled for 22/03) have been postponed until further notice.	Due to the closed borders especially with Hungary and Slovakia, maintaining 24h long-term care of the elderly is a major problem. Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border and a further 30% from the Slovak Republic. Slovaks, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. Though the Austrian government is in negotiations with its neighbours no solution has been reached so far. For the moment, the government has introduced two immediate measures for the 460.000 persons in need of care. Firstly, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional Civilian Servants can be mobilized this way, who are also needed in other areas. Secondly, federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for mobile and stationary care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments. A number of hotlines have been set up to provide Austrian with up-to-date and free info on the corona virus. The Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection set up a taskforce to provide scientific advice from a medial point of view. 	Chancellor Kurz has announced a comprehensive support package on 18 March amounting to up to EUR 38 Billion (around 10% of GDP but including tax deferals). The package encompasses credit guarantees of EUR 9 billion, a compartment for immediate help of EUR 4 billion, including EUR 400 million for short-time work via the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS), tax deferrals of up to EUR 10 billion and EUR 15 billion in form of credit guarantees and subsidies for hard-hit industries. Firms affected can claim a deferral of social contributions for the months February to April. Additional funds will be put aside to support the production of gloves, masks and several medicines in Austria. Further EUR 23 million are disbursed through an emergency-call for research by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) to incentivize eligible research on Covid-19 by Austrian firms.	All workers (private and public sector) can be requested to use two weeks of their leave and to deplete over-time hours. Short-time working (EUR 400 million, 0,1% of GDP): The budget of the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) was increased from EUR 20 million to EUR 400 million. It takes over the salary of all workers (except public service) including apprentices of min. 10% up to 90% of the working time according to collective bargaining agreements up to a certain threshold. This threshold depends on gross salary and is 90% for salaries below EUR 1,700, 85% for salaries below EUR 2,685 and 80% for salaries below EUR 5,370; apprentices will be compensated in full. Any application to the short-time working scheme will be handled within 48h. The Ministry of Finance will take over one third of labours costs for workers who have to take care of children up to an age of 14 due to closed schools or kindergartens.	Credit guarantees (EUR 9 billion, 2.3% of GDP): EUR 2 billion is devoted to the export credit scheme and intends to cover up to 15 % of operating costs of exporting companies. The Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (aws), a federal development and financing bank, supports firms of all sizes in all industries except the tourism sector, which is covered by the public Tourism bank. Those who are self-employed can tap the credit guarantees as well. The aws covers only credits necessary to preserve liquidity but does not cover debt restructurings. The minister of Finance has been entitled to increase the guarantee envelope. Emergency assistance (EUR 15 billion, 3.8% of GDP) to support industries hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Part of this emergency assistance is devoted to "hardship" cases across self-employed and micro-sized firms. Under certain conditions, they can get subsidies of up to EUR 6,000 for three months per entity. These subsidies have to be paid back.	The ECB has committed to "do everything necessary within its mandate" to support the economy through this shock. To preserve bank lending and liquidity, the ECB will temporarily conduct additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and lower the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). On the supervisory front, the ECB has temporarily lowered bank capital requirements and introduced flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans. Furthermore, the ECB has expanded its asset purchase programme by an overall EUR 870 billion (7.3% of euro area GDP) until the end of 2020, while opening the door to freeing its self-imposed limits. More details and additional measures are presented in the EU note.

All employers, if possible, are to introduce remote work for their employees. 	Routine medical consultations, examinations, immunizations, planned operations, and visits to all medical establishments have been stopped. Visits to nursing homes no longer allowed.	The government's priority has been to increase funding for the health sector response. The total amount of government support to the private sector and households is estimated to be around BGN 4.6 billion. The government is yet to announce the details of the major private sector support programs for employment and firm liquidity. The government indicated that the 2020 budget is likely to be updated. 	Employees can be requested to use half of their annual paid leave during the State of Emergency. In addition, the government will pay 60% of salaries for employees for three months facing being laid off, with employers paying the remaining 40%. The details on which companies can access this state assistance are to be drafted by the Cabinet. Expenditure on support for job retention in the sectors concerned is to reach BGN 1 billion (EUR 510 million). Doctors and nurses working in the frontline will receive an additional payment of BGN 1000 a month (EUR 510). The additional remuneration of medical and non-medical staff involved in the treatment of COVID 19 patients is estimated to BGN 60 million (EUR 30.6 million). The government will allocate BGN 200 million (EUR 102 million) to the Bulgarian Development Bank (BDB) for guaranteeing non-interest consumer loans up to BGN 1500 (EUR 765) for employees who have gone on unpaid leave. Certain taxes and fee due to government have been delayed, including the deadline for submission of the annual income tax return and for payment of the tax assessed has been extended until end-June firms/sole trades involved in commerce and farmers who pay tax under this regime.

BRA	30-Mar-2020	-11.694	-48.978	Brazil	No nationwide lockdown, but a request for people to stay at home. Some local governments have imposed stronger confinement measures. Authorizations for entry into indigenous lands are suspended, with the exception of those related to essential services.	All land borders are closed and entry by air from certain countries in Europe and Asia, plus Australia, is restricted to Brazilian nationals and residents.  Measures to restrict the movement of people and businesses operations are in place in big cities (Rio de Janeiro, S&atilde;o Paulo and Bras&iacute;lia, among others). Some Brazilian states are considering restricting movements across state borders.	Schools are not closed nationwide, but several states and municipalities have closed educational institutions. For example, in S&atilde;o Paulo, schools will be closed as of Monday 23/3.	Local authorities have cancelled many large events.	An additional 0.4% of GDP have been assigned to the public healthcare system. Taxes and import duties on goods used by hospitals have been zeroed and import procedures eased. Hiring of 2,000 new beds in ICUs announced.<Br/>Telemedicine services have been allowed. Physicians can make consultations online and issue electronically signed medical reports or prescriptions.Rapid test kits: the Federal government and states are preparing to distribute 10 million units.<Br/>	A state of emergency declaration by Congress exempts the government from meeting 2020 fiscal target. Brazil's government passed a large emergency package announced at 4.2% of GDP, but this also includes anticipated disbursements of benefits and postponed tax liabilities. New spending measures are around 2.9% of GDP. 	Informal workers and the unemployed will receive, over 3 months, a temporary new benefit of USD 120 per month (USD 240 for single mothers) provided that they earn less than half a minimum wage and are not covered by other social benefits except Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia (27/3). This may reach up to 20 million of Brazilians and the estimated fiscal cost is 0.6% of GDP. Additional spending of 0.04% of GDP on the conditional cash transfer programme Bolsa Familia aims at a rapid reduction of waiting lines for programme enrolment and could imply up to 1 million of additional beneficiaries. Formal workers with salaries not exceeding two minimum wages who have suffered cuts in salaries or working hours are eligible for additional public income support that will compensate around 15% of their average monthly earnings. Withdrawals from individual unemployment insurance accounts are made easier. 	For SMEs, an emergency credit line has been opened to cover 2 months of wages for employees earning up to 2 minimum wages, under the condition that the employee is not dismissed. This is a loan over 36 months, with a grace period of 6 months, and a nominal interest rate below current inflation. Payments are directly disbursed into workers' accounts, but firms are liable for the debt. 85% of the credit risk is borne by the federal government. Tax liabilities and other charges on firms are being postponed, with a particular focus on SMEs. The government will pay the first 15 days of sick leave for infected workers. <Br/>    The national development bank BNDES has announced new credit lines to companies with a loan volume of 0.6% of GDP. 	The policy rate Selic was cut by 50 bps on 18/3 to 3.75%. On 23/3 the Central Bank announced a liquidity injection worth 17% of GDP, to be implemented through lower reserve and capital requirements and special liquidity lines for banks. The Central Bank undertook repo operations to support the value of the currency. A USD 60 billion swap line with the US Federal Reserve will help Brazil manage pressures on its currency.

CHE	30-Mar-2020	47.012	8.351	Switzerland	Gatherings in public spaces of more than five people are prohibited. If five or fewer people meet, they must maintain a distance of two metres from one another. Anyone not complying with this rule will be fined. <Br/>This ban is valid until 19 April 2020. The Federal Council has banned public and private events. All establishments open to the public will be closed. This applies to shops and markets, restaurants, bars, leisure and entertainment establishments, businesses offering personal services involving physical contact such as hairdressers). <Br/>The ban does not apply to food stores and other shops selling articles for everyday use (e.g. kiosks and petrol station shops), takeaway establishments, staff canteens, meal delivery services and restaurants for hotel guests or pharmacies. <Br/>Classroom teaching is banned at schools, universities and other training and educational institutions. The ban will apply until 19 April 2020.	People from high-risk countries and areas will be refused entry into Switzerland.

Anyone wishing to enter Switzerland despite the entry ban must prove that one of the exceptional conditions is met.<Br/>This arrangement will apply for a maximum of 6 months. <Br/>Goods traffic is still permitted.	Classroom teaching is banned at schools, universities and other training and educational institutions. The ban will apply until 19 April 2020.	On March 16, the government declared a ban on all private and public events and closing bars, restaurants, sports and cultural spaces; only businesses providing essential goods  such as grocery stores, bakeries and pharmacies remain open. The measures are in force until April 19. The government forbid gathering of more than 5 people. 	Hospitals and clinics must stay open but only for necessary procedures. The army is contributing additional ambulances and personnel. To cope with the expected increase in the number of sick people, many cantons have also mobilised civil defence volunteers. 	CHF40 billion aid package aimed at helping companies survive the economic downturn caused by coronavirus. One part of the money is earmarked to fund the imposition of short-time work at firms. CHF20 billion are earmarked for a liquidity aid. 	Unemployed persons are covered by compulsory unemployment insurance. All persons entitled to benefits receive a maximum of 120 additional daily allowances. The administrative procedures to apply for short-time work (part-time unemployment benefit) have been eased at short notice: i) the waiting period to benefit from this indemnity is eliminated until September 30, 2020 (against 2 days previously, the first days being borne by the company); ii) Employees no longer have to reduce their overtime before they can benefit from short-time compensation. iii)The approval period for short-time work is extended from 3 to 6 months. In addition, urgent simplifications have been made in the area of processing applications and payments for short-time work. Short-time work compensation can now also be paid to employees on fixed-term contracts and to persons working for a temporary work organisation.Furthermore, short-time work compensation is accessible for employer-like employees (for example, shareholders of a limited liability company who work as salaried employees in the company), persons who work in the business of the spouse or registered partner as well as apprenticees, too. Self-employed persons are not entitled to short-time work compensation. However, if they suffer a loss of income due to the closure of a business or the ban on events ordered under federal law, they are entitled to compensation amounting to 80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day. 	Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation and paid out quickly. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. Businesses should have the possibility to extend payment deadlines without having to pay default interest. For this reason, the interest rate for VAT, customs duties, special excise taxes and incentive taxes will be reduced to 0.0 percent in the period from 21 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. No interest  will be charged during this period.   Companies affected by the crisis may be granted a temporary, interest-free deferral of payment of social security contributions. Companies also have the option of having the amount of the regular contributions adjusted if the sum of their wages has fallen significantly. The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.  Further help is available for companies of the sport and event industry as well as in tourism.     	On March 19, the Central Bank (SNB) maintained its expansionary monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate and the interest rate on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75%. Moreover, the SNB announced it would provide liquidity as part of the extended swap arrangements with other central banks, particularly in US dollars. To ensure the provision of sufficient liquidity to the banking system, the SNB decided to raise the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system. On March 25, the Confederation, the SNB and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authorities announced a package of measures together with the banks. In this context, the SNB is introducing the new SNB COVID-19 refinancing facility (CRF). This measure is aimed at strengthening the supply of credit to the Swiss economy by providing the banking system with additional liquidity. In these refinancing operations, the government-guaranteed bank loans serve as collateral. The CRF thus operates in conjunction with the federal government's guarantees for corporate loans. The setup is such that banks should be able to provide loans to small and medium enterprises within a day or two, starting March 26.On March 25, the SNB announced that it had recommended to the Confederation the deactivation of the anticyclical capital buffer. The deactivation should further enhance corporate credit supply by banks.

Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole. <Br/><Br/>* Other proposals by the Commission: <Br/>o   Extending the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund to cover major public health emergencies and to increase advance payments from this Fund (up to EUR 800 million available in 2020)<Br/>o   Using the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/>o   Providing EUR 1 billion from the EU budget as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing. <Br/>	Unavailable information	* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission has adopted a Temporary Framework, in place until end-2020, to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules.<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group has proposed a plan to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.	* In March the ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o Lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o Conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o Easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework.<Br/>o Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities. In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies.<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o Adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o Furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o Expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. <Br/>

Schools for younger children are still open at this stage.	- Relatives should avoid "unnecessary visits" to hospitals and elderly care institutions. <Br/><Br/>- Events with more than 50 persons are banned since 27 March. <Br/>	- The central government will compensate municipalities and regions for extraordinary measures and extra costs in health and medical care associated with the COVID-19 virus.<Br/><Br/>- Sickness benefit to be paid for the first day of sickness	The government has presented three comprehensive packages amounting to SEK 635 billion (about EUR 63.5 billion, nearly 13% of GDP), including liquidity provisions and credit guarantees if these are used by firms to the maximum..	- Postponement by 12 month of three month of preliminary income tax payments on salaries due between January and September 2020 (with interest charge)<Br/><Br/>- Sickness benefit qualifying day is temporarily discontinued and the government will assume the entire cost of all sick pay during April and May.<Br/><Br/>- Self-employed persons will be entitled to receive standardised sick pay for 14 days.	- On 16 March, the short-term layoffs scheme was introduced. Employees receive more than 90 per cent of their wages, but employers' wage costs can be halved, thanks to the government subsidy. The subsidy level is significantly higher than in the previous short-time work scheme (estimated cost: SEK 20 billion).<Br/><Br/>- Liquidity reinforcement via tax accounts: companies can defer three months payment of employer social security contributions, preliminary tax on salaries and value added tax that are reported monthly or quarterly for up to 12 months, with interest. The new regulations take effect on 30 April, but can be retroactively applied from 1 January 2020. If companies use this opportunity to the same extent as in 2009, this would amount to SEK 27 billion. If all companies would use it to the maximum, this would amount to SEK 315 billion. To support SMEs, it will also be allowed to defer the value-added tax reported annually. Hence, companies can defer the payment of last year's VAT that is due shortly. If this is used to the maximum, it can amount to SEK 7 billion. In addition, SMEs can claim back the preliminary tax paid in 2019 and either pay it later or set it off against future losses (the maximum liquidity reinforcement could amount to SEK 13 billion). <Br/><Br/>- The Swedish Parliament has allowed the Government to issue credit guarantees of up to SEK 5 billion in 2020 for loans to airlines that on 1 January this year had a Swedish permit to operate commercial aviation and who have their main operations or headquarters in Sweden. <Br/><Br/>- On 20 March, the government announced a new support package for small businesses: <Br/>o Almi, a state agency which offers loans to companies with growth potential and assists in their business development, will get a new capital grant of SEK 3 billion (about EUR 270 million, 0.06% of GDP) to allow it to lend more to SMEs.<Br/>o The Swedish Export Credit Agency's loan limit is extended to SEK 200 billion (about EUR 18 billion, 3.8% of GDP) from SEK 125 billion.<Br/>o The ceiling for credit guarantees from the agency which insures export companies and banks against the risk of non-payment in export transactions (EKN) is increased to SEK 500 billion (about EUR 45bn, 9.6% of GDP) from SEK 450 billion, the same amount as during the 2008 financial crisis, and the coverage is extended to encompass sea shipping. <Br/><Br/>- On 20 March, the government announced support amounting to SEK 500 million (EUR 45 million ; 0.01% of GDP) for cultural activities that lose revenue as a result of the restriction on public events and the same amount for sports. <Br/><Br/>- On 25 March, the government announced another crisis package for small enterprises: <Br/>o Government guarantee on 70% of new bank loans to companies experiencing financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 virus but otherwise robust, up to SEK 75 million (with possible exceptions).<Br/>o Temporary reduction of employers' social security contributions to the old age pension contribution only for the period 1 March to 30 June 2020, up to 30 employees and on the portion of the employee's wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month. This entails tax relief of up to SEK 5 300 per employee per month. An equivalent relief applies to sole proprietors (estimated cost: SEK 33 billion).<Br/>o Temporary discount for rental costs in vulnerable sectors, such as durable consumer goods, hotels, restaurants and certain other activities, with the government covering 50% of the rental reduction up to 50% of the fixed rent (estimated cost: SEK 5 billion).<Br/>o Measures targeting small enterprises: 100% of the taxable profits of sole proprietors and partners in Swedish partnerships for 2019, up to SEK 1 mn, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. VAT reported by sole proprietors annually from 27 December 2019 to 17 January 2021 will be eligible to deferral, with interest. These measures will provide a maximum liquidity reinforcement of more than SEK 20 billion.	- On 13 March, the Riksbank has decided to lend up to SEK 500 billion (about 10% of GDP) (about &euro;46 billion) to companies via the banks, to avoid robust companies being knocked out as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. Banks will be allowed to borrow an unlimited amount at 3-month's maturity on a weekly basis against collateral at an interest rate of 20 bp above the repo rate. Flexibility will be increased on collateral requirements for banks when they borrow money from the Riksbank. <Br/><Br/>- On 13 March, Finansinspektionen (FSA) lowered its countercyclical capital buffer from 2.5% percentage points to 0%. This amounts to SEK 45 bn and should create a capacity of around SEK 900 billion (about 18% of GDP) for new lending. The FSA also announced that it will postpone all new investigations and on sight supervisory activities, in order to free up resources at the banks. <Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, FSA announced that it considers the loss of income associated with COVID-19 to qualify as a special reason that allows the bank and borrower to reach an agreement to reduce or suspend loan amortisation payments for a limited period of time.  FSA also clarified that it will temporarily allow banks to fall below the liquidity coverage ratio requirements for individual currencies and total currencies. This measure relieves liquidity constraints.<Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, the Riksbank decided to increase purchases of securities by up to SEK 300 billion in 2020. Given relative scarcity of government bonds, purchases can include municipal and mortgage bonds (in the Nordics, there is a deep and liquid market for the latter) as well as non-financial corporate bonds and commercial papers. <Br/><Br/>- On 19 March, the Riksbank and the US Federal Reserve agreed on a swap facility of 60 billion USD. The agreement will be in place for at least six months.<Br/><Br/>- On 24 March, the FSA stressed that it expects credit institutions to stop this year's dividend payments and use the earnings to further strengthen their capital.
