Firms will be able to request support for their workers under this scheme if 10% of their workforce are affected by cuts in working hours as opposed to one third under the usual regulation. In addition to compensating 60% of the difference in monthly net earnings due to reduced hours, the labour agency will now also cover 100% of social-security contributions for the lost work hours. This is an increase compared to the financial crisis, where only 50% of social-security contributions were subsidised and employers had to cover the other half. Firms have already started to use “short-time” work more frequently over the past few months in response to the industrial downturn.  - The government announced it will provide all liquidity support needed to companies mostly through new and existing programs with the KfW. Credits will not be limited. Firm size limitations for liquidity support will also be adjusted upwards and the risk taken by the government will be increased. The volume of guarantees provided by guarantee banks will be doubled to €2.5 billion. Also, banks will be able to decide on guarantees more quickly. In addition, tax deferrals will be possible.

EU	03/17/2020	55	4.5	European Union					The Commission proposed to restrict non-essential travel to the European Union for an initial period of 30 days, with exceptions mainly for EU and British citizens, long-time residents, cross-border commuters, health care workers and workers delivering goods		A ban on events with more than 500 attendees until 31 May.	The Commission is taking stock of available equipment and of production and distribution capacity, and will pursue joint public procurements. Tensions have emerged as some member states have imposed tighter rules on exports of these supplies, potentially undermining the internal market. 	Proposal “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative” includes: <ul><li>Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds, worth about EUR 8 billion. Instead, they will be able to use this money as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (worth about EUR 29 bn, totalling EUR 37 bn).</li><li>Enlarged eligibility provisions comprise investment for public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs.</li><li>Cohesion policy total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged; there is no “new money” involved.</li><li>Flexibility in EC budget rules: When assessing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission will take account of the temporary nature of some COVID-19-related fiscal measures (“one-offs”) and of the outbreak being an unusual event outside the control of government. The required fiscal adjustment will take account of cyclical developments.</li><li>The general escape clause mat be activated in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole. </li></ul><Br/>Other proposals by the EC: <ul><li>Extending the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund to cover major public health emergencies and to increase advance payments from this Fund (up to EUR 800 million available in 2020)</li><li>Using the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)</li><li>Providing EUR 1 billion from the EU budget as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing. </li><ul>		The EC vowed to help member states ramp up their response by permitting aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is causing a serious disturbance to the economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty), which enables the Commission to approve additional national support measures.	On 12 March 2020 the ECB decided to ease financial conditions further: <ul><li>In TLTRO III operations, considerably more favourable terms will be applied during the period from June 2020 to June 2021. These operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, particularly SMEs. Throughout this period, the interest rate on these TLTRO III operations will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations.</li><li>Additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) will be conducted, temporarily, to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area financial system. They will be carried out through a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the average rate on the deposit facility (-0.50%).</li><li>A temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of €120 billion to be added until the end of the year, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes.</li><li>On the supervisory front, the ECB will allow banks to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities.</li></ul>
