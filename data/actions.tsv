This stage includes an increase in the allowed size of outdoor gatherings (now 10 people across most states), some reopening of caf&eacute;s and restaurants (albeit with restrictions on the number of diners) an increase in the size of indoor gatherings at home (usually up to five visitors allowed) and the number of guests permitted at weddings and funerals (the exact number differs by state, but usually from 10-20).  	2	Information not available	2	Total direct spending across Commonwealth and State Governments amounts to A$210bn (10&frac12;% of GDP). 	10.5	Total direct spending by Commonwealth and State Governments amounts to approximately A$210bn.	On 11 March, the Government committed an additional A$2.4 billion to support the health system to manage any further outbreak in Australia. The package provided support across primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the National Medical Stockpile, along with a national communication campaign. The package also provided funding to ensure Australia had sufficient personal protective equipment and medicines in addition to infection control training and programs for health and aged care workers.<Br/>On 15 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced that health services had moved into the 'Targeted Action' stage of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This included moving resources within hospitals to priority areas, establishing fever clinics which specialise in COVID-19, cancelling non-urgent elective surgeries to free up capacity in public hospitals and adapting hospital resources (i.e. rooms and equipment) for use in priority areas, such as Intensive Care Units. <Br/>On 29 March, the Prime Minister announced an additional A$1.1 billion in funding for mental health services, domestic violence support, Medicare assistance for people at home (including through telehealth services) and emergency food relief.<Br/>On 31 March, the Government announced a partnership with private health providers for their infrastructure, essential equipment, supplies, workforce and additional resources to be made available to the public health system. In return, the government would ensure the viability of these enterprises. In essence, this agreement will integrate the private and public health systems in the event that capacity in the public system is strained. <Br/>On 26 April, the government launched the new voluntary app, COVIDSafe. It is intended that the app will help with tracking and tracing COVID-19 infections. <Br/>On 27 April, the first phase in reinstating elective surgeries commenced. <Br/>	0.18	A$3.5bn	On 30 March, the Commonwealth Government announced a planned wage subsidy to businesses (A$130bn or 6&frac12;% of GDP) to encourage them to keep workers in jobs. A &ldquo;JobKeeper Payment&rdquo; of A$1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee will be paid to the business under the condition that every eligible employee receives at least A$ 1,500 per fortnight from the business. The Jobkeeper Payment covers full-time and part-time employees, as well as employees stood down ahead of the commencement of the scheme, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months and the self employed. Eligible businesses are those with a turnover of less than A$1 billion that can demonstrate a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable month one year ago (firms with turnover of greater than A$1 billion must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in turnover). The programme commenced 30 March, with the first payments being received by eligible businesses in the first week of May as monthly arrears from the Australian Taxation Office.<Br/>There has been a temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight.  This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. The supplement will be paid for the next six months. <Br/>Social security and veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders will receive up to two separate cash payments of $750 (those who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive the second cash payment of A$750). <Br/>The government has announced some relaxation of the partner income test for employees applying for unemployment benefits and the Coronavirus Supplement of A$550 per fortnight. An individual can now receive these benefits provided that their partner earns less than A$79,762 per annum (the threshold was previously less than A$48k). <Br/>On April 2, a subsidy to childcare providers was announced, conditional on them staying open and not charging families for care. The Commonwealth Government will pay 50 per cent of the sector's fee revenue up to the existing hourly rate cap. The funding will apply from 6 April based on the number of children who were in care during the fortnight leading into 2 March, whether or not they are attending services. <Br/>Some labour market regulations have also been temporarily relaxed for the duration of the crisis. Across a large range of work types (103 of the 121 modern awards), employees will receive two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave. The covered employees will also be allowed to take double the duration of annual leave at half pay. There have also been changes to three specific awards that cover about 2 million workers, those related to restaurants, hospitality and the clerks award. These changes will allow an individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification perform another type of duty in another type of classification.<Br/>	7.66	A$152.9bn	New Commonwealth Government measures include support for business investment, including by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access to this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures. Measures have also been implemented to support business cash flows (including through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). <Br/><Br/><Br/>	1.86	A$37bn	Information not available	--		On 12 March, the Australian Taxation Office announced a range of measures to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). These have been complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits. 	--		Information not available	--		Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government will guarantee 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility will be A$40bn (2% of GDP). Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, businesses with up to A$10mn in total loan facilities will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.	2	A$40bn	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent); 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent; 3) the introduction of a A$90bn (4.5% of GDP) term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses; 4) Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/>	On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  	0.1	A$2bn	On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants. On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.	--		Information not available	Information not available

They are expected to open on May, 15.  Schools are reopened first for graduating classes, then subsequently for other students as well, conditional that the virus is still relatively contained.<Br/><Br/>	3	* Austrian authorities have enforced a country-wide lockdown since March 16. <Br/><Br/>* As of March 10, big indoor and outdoor events have been cancelled and the government closed the external border with Italy. <Br/><Br/>* On March 13, authorities announced the closure of schools from March 16 on and closed all shops besides supermarkets, pharmacies and a couple of other essential shops (a full list of businesses still allowed to open is found here). Museums, monuments, restaurants and bars are also closed. <Br/>	3	* From April 3 on, authorities allow to order and pick up take-a-way food from restaurants, though guests are still prohibited from eating on the premises. <Br/><Br/>* On April 6, authorities have announced a gradual lift of the lockdown.<Br/>o From April 14 on, small shops (< 400m2), small handicraft businesses, hardware stores and garden centers are allowed to open for business.<Br/>o All other shops, including hairdressers, may open from May 1 onwards.<Br/>o Restaurants, bars and hotels remain closed, at least until the end of April.<Br/>o Public events remain prohibited at least until end of June.<Br/>o Schools and universities remain closed until mid-May.	1	* A budget envelope of currently EUR 38 billion (10% of GDP including credit guarantees and tax deferrals) is gradually implemented and operationalized. Austrian authorities have signaled to mobilize additional help if needed. <Br/><Br/>* The budget envelope consists of the following items, which are already implemented or soon to be implemented:<Br/>o Emergency funds for hard-hit industries which provides direct liquidity provisions and subsidies for running costs (EUR 15 billion).<Br/>o Credit guarantees (up to EUR 9 billion).<Br/>o Tax deferrals (up to EUR 10 billion) for personal income and corporate income taxes. Taxes can be deferred until end of September. Deferrals of social security contributions are possible for the months February to April.<Br/>o A compartment of EUR 4 billion including funds for short-time working (EUR 1 billion), as well as EUR 1 billion for hardship cases across freelancers, family enterprises and sole proprietorships and funds to finance increased costs of caretaking.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* Further EUR 36 million are disbursed through an emergency-call for research by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) to incentivize eligible research on Covid-19 by Austrian firms. <Br/><Br/>* Moreover, the government has spent around EUR 13 million on medical supplies.<Br/>	Around 7% of GDP (credit guarantees counted in but not tax deferrals)	Information not available	Due to the closed borders especially with Hungary and the Slovak Republic, maintaining 24h long-term care of the elderly is a major problem. Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border and a further 30% from the Slovak Republic. Slovaks, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. <Br/><Br/>For the moment, the government has introduced two immediate measures for the 460.000 persons in need of care. Firstly, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional Civilian Servants can be mobilized this way. Secondly, federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for mobile and stationary care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments. Lower Austria flied in 231 care-takes directly from Bulgaria and Romania. From May on, train traffic through Hungary for Romanian care-takers will be resumed.<Br/><Br/>From April 1 on, the government has introduced further measures to contain the propagation of the virus. Wearing masks is now mandatory in open spaces, including supermarkets. Vulnerable people have to work from home. <Br/><Br/>The government has started testing representative samples of Austrians for infection with Covid-19. A first test with 2,197 Austrians suggested a rather low rate of infection (around 1% of total population). Further testing with larger samples are planned in the near future.<Br/>	--		* All workers (private and public sector) can be requested to use all remaining leave days from last year and to deplete any over-time hours.  <Br/><Br/>* Short-time working (EUR 5 billion): The Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) takes over the salary of all workers (except public service) including apprentices of min. 10% up to 90% of the working time according to collective bargaining agreements up to a certain threshold (100% for apprentices). This threshold depends on gross salary and is 90% for salaries below EUR 1,700, 85% for salaries below EUR 2,685 and 80% for salaries below EUR 5,370; apprentices will be compensated in full. Any application to the short-time working scheme will be handled within 48h. The employer's share of social security contributions is covered as well.<Br/><Br/>* The Ministry of Finance will take over one third of labour costs for workers who have to take care of children up to an age of 14 due to closed schools or kindergartens.<Br/><Br/>* Short-time working is limited to three months with the possibility to reapply for another three months.<Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Swift support measures (up to EUR 4 billion)<Br/><Br/>* Self-employed and micro-sized enterprises (< 10 employees) are supported by EUR 2 billion.<Br/><Br/>* A single entity can tap up to EUR 6,000 within three months.<Br/><Br/>Credit guarantees (of up to EUR 9 billion)<Br/><Br/>* Around EUR 2 billion is provided through an export credit scheme and intends to cover up to 15 % of operating costs of exporting companies. <Br/><Br/>* General liquidity provisions are granted by the Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (aws), a federal development and financing bank. <Br/><Br/>* The aws supports firms of all sizes in all industries except the tourism sector, which is covered by the public Tourism bank.

On the supervisory front, the ECB has temporarily lowered bank capital requirements and introduced flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans. Furthermore, the ECB has expanded its asset purchase programme by an overall EUR 870 billion (7.3% of euro area GDP) until the end of 2020, while opening the door to freeing its self-imposed limits.

The Commission recommended to extend restrictions until 15 June. Exceptions mainly cover EU and British citizens, long-time residents, cross-border commuters, health care workers and workers delivering goods. Movement of goods is not to be affected. With regard to internal border controls in the Schengen area, member states have endorsed the guidelines proposed by the Commission on border management, which call inter alia for proportionality and non-discrimination between own nationals and resident EU citizens.	3	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	* The EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII; proposed on 13 March, in force since 1 April) will accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April and in force since 24 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April). Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.<Br/><Br/>* At the request of Member States, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/><Br/>*   EUR 1 billion has been provided as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing (announced on 13 March, implemented on 6 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 9 April, EU finance ministers decided to establish Pandemic Crisis Support credit lines within the framework of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Access granted will be 2% of the respective country's GDP as of end-2019, as a benchmark (about &euro;240 billion in total). The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. The only requirement to access the credit line is that euro area Member States requesting support would commit to use this credit line to finance direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis. On 8 May, the Eurogroup agreed on further details: requests for Pandemic Crisis Support may be made until end-2022 (with the possibility to adjust this deadline) and the ensuing loans to countries will have a maximum average maturity of 10 years and favourable pricing modalities. On May 15, the Board of Governors of the ESM approved the establishment of Pandemic Crisis Support.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission adopted on 19 March a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules. This Framework was extended on 3 April, and then on 8 May, to cover additional types of aid. It will be in place until end-2020 (for recapitalisation measures, until end of June 2021).<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced on 16 March a plan (currently being deployed) to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.<Br/><Br/>* In addition to the above plan, EU finance ministers endorsed on 9 April an EIB proposal to create a EUR 25 billion guarantee fund, which will support up to EUR 200 billion of financing for companies (especially SMEs) throughout the EU. The scheme will be implemented by the EIB Group, in close partnership with national promotional banks and other financial intermediaries. By guaranteeing parts of loan portfolios, operations under the guarantee fund will free up capital for the financial intermediaries involved to make further financing available for SMEs and mid-caps.<Br/><Br/>* The Commission presented on 2 April a proposal for a new European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE). SURE support will take the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States, to help them cover the costs directly related to the creation or extension of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures for the self-employed, in the context of the current crisis. EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. An instrument along these lines was endorsed by EU finance ministers on 9 April. On May 20, a Regulation establishing SURE entered into force. Countries will be able to use loans also in support of some health-related measures, esp. in the workplace. SURE will become available once all Member States have provided the required guarantees proportionally to gross national income, and will remain available until end-2022 (with the possibility to adjust this deadline).	Information not available	Information not available	* The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry.<Br/><Br/>* On 19 March, the Commission decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile was EUR 50 million, subsequently increased to EUR 80 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.<Br/><Br/>* On 2 April, the Commission presented a legislative proposal (in force since 15 April) to activate and extend the scope of the Emergency Support Instrument, with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget to directly purchase or procure emergency support on behalf of Member States, financially support and co-ordinate pressing needs such as the transportation of medical equipment and of patients in cross-border regions, and support the construction of mobile field hospitals.<Br/><Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		* The ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o 12 March: lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o 12 March: conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o 18 March, further detailed on 7 April: easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework. These measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, include expanding the use of credit claims as collateral, reducing collateral valuation haircuts and taking a number of other temporary steps, such as a waiver to accept Greek sovereign debt instruments as collateral.<Br/>o 22 April: adopting temporary measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades. More specifically, the ECB will grandfather the eligibility of marketable assets and the issuers of such assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 in the event of downgrades, as long as the ratings remain at or above BB.<Br/>o 30 April: reducing further the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) until June 2021, to 50 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/>o 30 April: conducting a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). These will consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o 12 March: adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o 18 March: furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o 18 March: expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. 	* Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities (12 March). In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March), and announced a temporary reduction in capital requirements for market risk (16 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 28 April, the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation (EU) 575/2013) to provide temporary capital relief to banks. These changes include inter alia extending by 2 years the current transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital, a later date of application of the leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important institutions, a more favourable treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the NPL prudential backstop (the minimum loss coverage requirement for non-performing loans), and advancing the date of application of capital reduction factors in respect of certain loans to SMEs or in support of infrastructure investments.

On the 14 of April, the Reserve Bank decided a further cut of 100 basis points to 4.25% of the repo rate. ii. Monetary policy rates: On the 19th of March the Reserve Bank decided to cut the repo rate from 6.25 to 5.25%. <Br/>iii. liquidity injections: On March 20, the Reserve Bank announced three measures to ease money market liquidity:<Br/>1. Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations: The SARB will, through its Open Market Operations Desk, conduct Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations (IOSROs) to provide intraday liquidity support to clearing banks, except on Wednesdays, when the main repurchase transaction is conducted. IOSROs will be carried out through a fixed-rate auction with a pro-rata allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the repurchase (repo) rate. <Br/>2. Weekly Main Refinancing Operations: The additional money market liquidity provided to clearing banks via the IOSROs will result in the current money market shortage (MMS) declining below the current target level of R56 billion. The size of the Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) will be kept at R56 billion and increased if necessary.<Br/>3. Standing Facilities:  The Standing Facilities (SF) borrowing rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB absorbs liquidity <Br/>- will be adjusted to the repo rate less 200 basis points, from the current repo rate less 100 basis points. The SARB deems this change necessary in order to encourage the flow of money market liquidity. The SF lending rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB provides liquidity to the commercial banks <Br/>- will be adjusted lower to the repo rate, from the prevailing rate of the repo rate plus 100 basis points. This will support banks to facilitate their flow of money market liquidity without being penalised. 	1) The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of banks has been reduced from 100% to 80% (Directive 1 of 2020); 2) Temporary capital relief is provided in a manner which still complies with international standards. The Regulations provide that banks shall have in place robust policies, processes and procedures to ensure that the bank continuously maintains, in addition to the base minimum capital requirement of eight per cent of risk weighted assets, a systemic risk capital requirement (Pillar 2A), an idiosyncratic risk capital requirement (Pillar 2b), a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical buffer (CCyB) and a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) buffer. Both the CCyB and D-SIB buffers, when imposed, are an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The relief provided is that the Pillar 2A requirement is reduced to zero. South Africa has not implemented the countercyclical capital buffers as there has not been an excess aggregate credit extension thus banks are not required to maintain capital for systemic risk. Banks have built up a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent stipulated in terms of Regulation 38(8)(e)(D) hence banks are permitted to draw down from this buffer in this period of financial distress. the relief in response to the Covid-19 pandemic for banks to extend credit in the real economy and not for banks to distribute dividends. The Pillar 2A capital requirement will be re-imposed on banks after the financial stress period as will be directed by the PA. (Directive 2 of 2020). 3) The PA issued Directive 3 of 2020, which signals approval of the actions taken by banks to assist borrowers. This includes selected short-term payment holidays and loan restructures. The PA is providing credit risk capital relief to banks. Loans had to be up to date on 29 February 2020 in order to qualify for the relief. Retail (which include residential mortgage advances, retail revolving credit, SME retail and retail other) and corporate (which include corporate, SME corporate and the various specialised lending asset classes) would be able to qualify. A)Prudential authority issued a proposal on March 26 effective from April 1st, which includes dropping minimum capital requirements and compulsory reserve funds for lenders, reducing the liquidity coverage ratio to 80% from 100% and relaxing accounting standards when determining potential losses.
