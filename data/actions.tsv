All shops and public spaces are closed from March 20 until 26 April.	The construction of 12 new emergency hospitals has been announced. The government is cooperating with domestic equipment producers and laboratories to increase their supply and has started decentralised testing throughout the country as of 28 March. It has purchased 200,000 reagents for large-scale testing activities and the health system disposes of 8500 Intensive Care Units, which are supposed to be increased to 10,000. All workers in the health sector will receive a monthly bonus of 75 USD from April until July 2020. Prices for personal care, drugs and medical products have been fixed until the end of the health emergency situation. Exports of medical equipment necessary for the treatment of COVID infected patients require prior authorisation from the government. As of 1 April, imports of medical supplies and vaccines are exempted from import duties until the end of the emergency situation. Social security contributions for companies providing healthcare-related services are reduced by 95%.	Public investment will be boosted by around 0.5% of GDP (USD 1.5 bn), mainly in road infrastructure, housing and school construction as well as infrastructure for tourism. Public credit subsidies for private housing construction will be reinstated and extended, providing opportunities to refurbish homes during confinement, with a focus on domestically produced materials. Other measures to mitigate the economic costs of the crisis for households and businesses are detailed below.<br>In sectors particularly affected by the lockdown such as entertainment, transport, restaurants and hotels, the government will exempt employers from social security contributions. A specific committee has been created to establish objective criteria for accessing these benefits (6 April). 	- Households that live from informal activities, self-employment or domestic work and have suffered income losses will receive a one-off bonus of USD 150 in April.<Br/><Br/>- Conditional cash transfers to poor families are boosted by a one-off bonus of USD 50.<Br/><Br/>- Retirees and non-contributory pension beneficiaries with minimum pensions will obtain a USD 50 one-off bonus, while other benefits will be topped up to the new level of the regular minimum pension after including the bonus.<Br/><Br/>- Employers are not allowed to fire workers during a period of 60 days (as of 31 March), if the reason is related to the confinement measures or an unfair cause.<Br/><Br/>- Employers are required to pay part of the salaries of confined private sector workers, and negotiations between social partners will determine the respective amounts.<Br/><Br/>- People aged 60 and above, pregnant women and people in risk groups are dispensed from working and cannot face any negative consequences as a result.<Br/><Br/>- Unemployment insurance protection has been reinforced raising benefits for workers dismissed without a fair cause during the lockdown.<Br/><Br/>- Public food programmes are expanded.<Br/><Br/>- All workers in the health sector will receive a monthly bonus of 75 USD from April until July.<Br/><Br/>- Workers in the security and public defense sector receive a one-off bonus of USD 75 in April. <Br/><br>- During the health emergency, access to electricity, gas, water as well as internet will not be suspended for households unable to pay their bills.<Br/><Br/>- All rent contracts are automatically prolonged until 30 September, rents are fixed at their March levels and tenants cannot be forced to leave apartments due to non-payment of rents (as of 29 March).<Br/><Br/>- Until 30 April, banks are not allowed to close accounts due to bounced checks. <Br/><Br/>- As of 1 April, road toll collection is suspended.<Br/><Br/>- Prices for food, personal care, drugs and medical products have been fixed since 19 March until the end of the health emergency situation.

A specific committee has been created to establish objective criteria for accessing these benefits (6 April). <br>Public banks will support private companies with working capital for up to 180 days. This measure targets firms most affected by the lockdown, especially small and medium size enterprises. Rates will be around half of current inflation, with an estimated fiscal cost of around 0.33% of GDP. Part of these credits will be directed to companies producing foodstuff, medicaments and hygienic articles as well as equipment necessary for teleworking. To protect banks, soft-credit lines will be guaranteed by the State through a Public Credit Guarantee Fund which has received additional resources from the government. <br>Public credit guarantees for bank lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) producing food and basic supplies have been reinforced.<br>- During the health emergency, access to electricity, gas, water and internet will not be suspended for SMEs unable to pay their bills.<Br/><Br/>- A stay on both bank account closures due to bounced checks and credit denial to companies with payroll tax arrears helps securing acess to banking services for affected companies.	Monetary policy has been loosened considerably with policy rates decreasing by 25 percentage points since January and strong increases in the monetary base in March and April.<br>Bank lending has been encouraged through lower reserve requirements for bank lending to households or SMEs, limits to bank holdings of Central Bank papers, and temporary easing of bank provisioning needs and of bank loan classification rules (i.e. extra 60 days to be classified as non-performing).	
AUS	14-Apr-2020	-24.578	133.582	Australia	From 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020, only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days. From 28 March, all travellers arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14 day self-isolation at designated facilities. Interstate travel is possible, but individual states have introduced a requirement to self isolate for 14 days after arrival. As from 29 March, gatherings are limited to two people. However, different States have introduced policies that are tailored to their situation. For example, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania are three states advising that residents should stay inside their homes unless for essential reasons (e.g. obtaining food, going to work or education, medical reasons, providing care or exercise).<br>Information not available	Only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. From 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020, only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days. From 28 March, all travellers arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14 day self-isolation at designated facilities. On 24 March, it was announced that Australians are not allowed to take a return trip overseas, unless in exceptional circumstances. Cruise ships from foreign ports have been banned.  <Br/>On 27 March 2020, the Western Australian government imposed restrictions on travel within the state. Western Australians will not be permitted to leave their regional boundary unless under exceptional circumstances (e.g. employment purposes, medical reasons, health and emergency services, people living in border communities, transport of essential goods, compassionate grounds). Several States have announced restrictions on travellers from other regions of Australia. For instance, since 5 April, individuals are no longer able to enter Western Australia unless an exemption has been granted. 	No national blanket closure of schools. Public schools in several sub-national jurisdictions have moved to online-only learning. Private and independent schools exercise discretion on closure and delivery methods.	The government (National Cabinet, made up of the Prime Minister, premiers and territory leaders) has now limited both indoor and outdoor gatherings to two persons only.Exceptions to this limit include: i) People of the same household going out together; ii) Funerals (a maximum of 10 people); iii) Wedding (a maximum of 5 people); iv) Family units.The government's strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for: i) shopping for what you need (food and necessary supplies); ii) medical or health care needs, including compassionate requirements; iii) exercise in compliance with the public gathering requirements; iv) work and study if you can't work or learn remotely. However, each State Government has adopted rules that are unique to their situation. In all jurisdictions, playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms in public places have been closed.  	On 11 March, the Government committed an additional A$2.4 billion to support the health system to manage any further outbreak in Australia. The package provided support across primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the National Medical Stockpile, along with a national communication campaign. The package also provided funding to ensure Australia had sufficient personal protective equipment and medicines in addition to infection control training and programs for health and aged care workers.<Br/>On 15 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced that health services had moved into the 'Targeted Action' stage of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This included moving resources within hospitals to priority areas, establishing fever clinics which specialise in COVID-19, cancelling elective surgeries to free up capacity in public hospitals and adapting hospital resources (i.e. rooms and equipment) for use in priority areas, such as Intensive Care Units. <Br/>On 29 March, the Prime Minister announced an additional A$1.1 billion in funding for mental health services, domestic violence support, Medicare assistance for people at home (including through telehealth services) and emergency food relief.<Br/>On 31 March, the Government announced a partnership with private health providers for their infrastructure, essential equipment, supplies, workforce and additional resources to be made available to the public health system. In return, the government would ensure the viability of these enterprises. In essence, this agreement will integrate the private and public health systems in the event that capacity in the public system is strained. <Br/>	Total direct spending across Commonwealth and State Governments amounts to A$208.7bn (10&frac12;% of GDP). State Government stimulus packages include:<Br/><Br/>* The Victorian government announced a A$1.7bn (0.1% of GDP) stimulus that included a fund to provide employment for some dismissed workers, payroll tax refunds for businesses and supports for firms in the worst-affected sectors. <Br/><Br/>* The New South Wales government has announced two stimulus packages totalling around A$3bn (0.2% of GDP) package that included payroll tax relief for firms and new capital projects. <Br/><Br/>* The Queensland government have announced a A$4bn (0.2% of GDP) stimulus package including the establishment of a loan facility for impacted businesses, payroll tax relief and discount utility bills for households. <Br/><Br/>* The Western Australian government announced a A$607mn package (0.03% of GDP) that included a freeze on household fees and charges and payroll tax relief for firms. <Br/><Br/>* The Tasmanian government has announced approximately A$985mn (0.05% of GDP) in measures that includes payments to households, health spending, interest free loans to small businesses and payroll tax waivers for businesses in sectors most heavily impacted and targeted industry assistance.<Br/><Br/>* The South Australian government has announced A$1bn (0.05% of GDP) in measures. These include a fund to provide employment opportunities, payroll tax relief, land tax relief, a one-off boost of A$500 for households who are receiving welfare support and a waiver of liquor licence fees for 2020-21 for those hotels, restaurants, cafes and clubs forced to close. <Br/><Br/>* The Australian Capital Territory announced a A$137 million stimulus package targeting vulnerable households through cash payments and small business through the provision of credit and a fund for contractors to undertake simple works on government assets. <Br/><Br/>* The Northern Territory announced a A$115 million stimulus package including payroll tax exemption, grants to businesses and not-for-profit and community organisations and a home improvement scheme.<Br/><br>New Commonwealth Government measures include support for business investment, including by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access to this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures. Measures have also been implemented to support business cash flows (including through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). <Br/><Br/><Br/>	On 30 March, the Commonwealth Government announced a planned wage subsidy to businesses (A$130bn or 6&frac12;% of GDP) to encourage them to keep workers in jobs. A &ldquo;JobKeeper Payment&rdquo; of A$1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee will be paid to the business under the condition that every eligible employee receives at least A$ 1,500 per fortnight from the business. The Jobkeeper Payment covers full-time and part-time employees, as well as employees stood down ahead of the commencement of the scheme, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months and the self employed. Eligible businesses are those with a turnover of less than A$1 billion that can demonstrate a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable month one year ago (firms with turnover of greater than A$1 billion must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in turnover). The programme commenced 30 March, with the first payments being received by eligible businesses in the first week of May as monthly arrears from the Australian Taxation Office.<Br/>There has been a temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight.  This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. The supplement will be paid for the next six months. <Br/>Social security and veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders will receive up to two separate cash payments of $750 (those who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive the second cash payment of A$750). <Br/>The government has announced some relaxation of the partner income test for employees applying for unemployment benefits and the Coronavirus Supplement of A$550 per fortnight. An individual can now receive these benefits provided that their partner earns less than A$79,762 per annum (the threshold was previously less than A$48k). <Br/>On April 2, a subsidy to childcare providers was announced, conditional on them staying open and not charging families for care. The Commonwealth Government will pay 50 per cent of the sector's fee revenue up to the existing hourly rate cap. The funding will apply from 6 April based on the number of children who were in care during the fortnight leading into 2 March, whether or not they are attending services. <Br/>Some labour market regulations have also been temporarily relaxed for the duration of the crisis. Across a large range of work types (103 of the 121 modern awards), employees will receive two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave. The covered employees will also be allowed to take double the duration of annual leave at half pay. There have also been changes to three specific awards that cover about 2 million workers, those related to restaurants, hospitality and the clerks award. These changes will allow an individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification perform another type of duty in another type of classification.<Br/><br>The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  	On 12 March, the Australian Taxation Office announced a range of measures to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). These have been complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits. <br>Information not available<br>Information not available<br>Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government will guarantee 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility will be A$40bn (2% of GDP). Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, businesses with up to A$10mn in total loan facilities will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.<br>On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants. On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent); 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent; 3) the introduction of a A$90bn (4.5% of GDP) term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses; 4) Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/><br>On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	
AUT	14-Apr-2020	47.65	14.705	Austria	Besides a country-wide lockdown, authorities have enforced a strict quarantine in a number of municipalities across four Austrian regions. <Br/><Br/>Tyrol (external borders with DEI and ITA)<Br/><Br/>* Two popular ski regions (Paznauntal, St. Anton/Arlberg) have been under quarantine since March 13.<Br/><Br/>* The rest of Tyrol has been quarantined since March 19.<Br/><Br/>* The region-wide quarantine was lifted on April 7, though Paznauntal, St. Anton and S&ouml;lden remain quarantined at least until Aril 13. <Br/><Br/>Salzburg region (external borders with DEU and ITA) <Br/><Br/>* Several municipalities (Gasteinertal, Gro&szlig;arltal, Flachau) have been quarantined since March 19.<Br/><Br/>* The quarantine was extended to Zell am See, Saalbach-Hinterglemm and Altenmarkt im Pongau on March 31.<Br/><Br/>* The quarantine in Gasteinertal, Gro&szlig;arltal, Flachau, Saalbach-Hinterglemm and Zell am See was lifted on April 13.<Br/><Br/>Vorarlberg (external borders with CHE, DEU and LIE)<Br/><Br/>* The municipalities Lech-Z&uuml;rs, Warth, Schr&ouml;cken, Stuben, Nenzing-Dorf and Nenzing-Beschling were quarantined from March 19 to April 3.<Br/><Br/>Carinthia (external borders with ITA and SVN)<Br/><Br/>* Heiligenblut was under quarantine from March 19 to March 29.<br>* From April 3 on, authorities allow to order and pick up take-a-way food from restaurants, though guests are still prohibited from eating on the premises. <Br/><Br/>* On April 6, authorities have announced a gradual lift of the lockdown.<Br/>o From April 14 on, small shops (< 400m2), small handicraft businesses, hardware stores and garden centers are allowed to open for business.<Br/>o All other shops, including hairdressers, may open from May 1 onwards.<Br/>o Restaurants, bars and hotels remain closed, at least until the end of April.<Br/>o Public events remain prohibited at least until end of June.<Br/>o Schools and universities remain closed until mid-May.	* The government has restricted access on Austria's external borders. Freight transport, transits and returning Austrians are exempted.<Br/><Br/>* Official air and external train traffic is suspended.	Since March 16, all schools are closed at least until mid-May.  	* Austrian authorities have enforced a country-wide lockdown since March 16. <Br/><Br/>* As of March 10, big indoor and outdoor events have been cancelled and the government closed the external border with Italy. <Br/><Br/>* On March 13, authorities announced the closure of schools from March 16 on and closed all shops besides supermarkets, pharmacies and a couple of other essential shops (a full list of businesses still allowed to open is found here). Museums, monuments, restaurants and bars are also closed. <Br/>	Due to the closed borders especially with Hungary and the Slovak Republic, maintaining 24h long-term care of the elderly is a major problem. Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border and a further 30% from the Slovak Republic. Slovaks, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. Though the Austrian government is in negotiations with its neighbours no solution has been reached so far. <Br/><Br/>For the moment, the government has introduced two immediate measures for the 460.000 persons in need of care. Firstly, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional Civilian Servants can be mobilized this way. Secondly, federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for mobile and stationary care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments. Lower Austria flied in 231 care-takes directly from Bulgaria and Romania. <Br/><Br/>From April 1 on, the government has introduced further measures to contain the propagation of the virus. Wearing masks is now mandatory in open spaces, including supermarkets. Vulnerable people have to work from home. <Br/><Br/>The government has started testing representative samples of Austrians for infection with Covid-19. A first test with 2,197 Austrians suggested a rather low rate of infection (around 1% of total population). Further testing with larger samples are planned in the near future.<Br/>	* A budget envelope of currently EUR 38 billion (10% of GDP including credit guarantees and tax deferrals) is gradually implemented and operationalized.

Movement of goods is not to be affected. With regard to internal border controls in the Schengen area, member states have endorsed the guidelines proposed by the Commission on border management, which call inter alia for proportionality and non-discrimination between own nationals and resident EU citizens.	Information not available	Information not available	* The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry.<Br/><Br/>* On 19 March, the Commission decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile is EUR 50 million, which the Commission has proposed to increase to EUR 80 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.<Br/><Br/>* On 2 April, the Commission presented legislative proposals for an Emergency Support Instrument for the healthcare sector, with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget to directly purchase or procure emergency support on behalf of Member States, financially support and co-ordinate pressing needs such as the transportation of medical equipment and of patients in cross-border regions, and support the construction of mobile field hospitals.<Br/><Br/>	* The EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII; proposed on 13 March, in force since 1 April) will accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April).

Access granted will be 2% of the respective country's GDP as of end-2019, as a benchmark (about &euro;240 billion in total). The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. The only requirement to access the credit line is that euro area Member States requesting support would commit to use this credit line to finance direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission adopted on 19 March a Temporary Framework, in place until end-2020, to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules.<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced on 16 March a plan (currently being deployed) to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps.

The scheme will be implemented by the EIB Group, in close partnership with national promotional banks and other financial intermediaries. <Br/><Br/>* The Commission presented on 2 April a proposal for a new instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE). SURE support will take the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States, to help them cover the costs directly related to the creation or extension of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures for the self-employed, in the context of the current crisis. EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees voluntarily committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. An instrument along these lines was endorsed by EU finance ministers on 9 April.<br>Information not available	Information not available<br>Information not available	Information not available<br>Information not available<br>Information not available<br>Information not available<br>Information not available	* The ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o 12 March: lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o 12 March: conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o 18 March: easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework.<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o 12 March: adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o 18 March: furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o 18 March: expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. <br>o Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities (12 March). In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March).<Br/>

Monetary policy rates: On the 19th of March the Reserve Bank decided to cut the repo rate from 6.25 to 5.25%. <Br/>iii. liquidity injections: On March 20, the Reserve Bank announced three measures to ease money market liquidity:<Br/>1. Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations: The SARB will, through its Open Market Operations Desk, conduct Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations (IOSROs) to provide intraday liquidity support to clearing banks, except on Wednesdays, when the main repurchase transaction is conducted. IOSROs will be carried out through a fixed-rate auction with a pro-rata allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the repurchase (repo) rate. <Br/>2. Weekly Main Refinancing Operations: The additional money market liquidity provided to clearing banks via the IOSROs will result in the current money market shortage (MMS) declining below the current target level of R56 billion. The size of the Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) will be kept at R56 billion and increased if necessary.<Br/>3. Standing Facilities:  The Standing Facilities (SF) borrowing rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB absorbs liquidity <Br/>- will be adjusted to the repo rate less 200 basis points, from the current repo rate less 100 basis points. The SARB deems this change necessary in order to encourage the flow of money market liquidity. The SF lending rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB provides liquidity to the commercial banks <Br/>- will be adjusted lower to the repo rate, from the prevailing rate of the repo rate plus 100 basis points. This will support banks to facilitate their flow of money market liquidity without being penalised. <br>Prudential authority issued a proposal on March 26 effective from April 1st, which includes dropping minimum capital requirements and compulsory reserve funds for lenders, reducing the liquidity coverage ratio to 80% from 100% and relaxing accounting standards when determining potential losses.

SWE	15-Apr-2020	65.903	18.572	Sweden	Since early March, everyone with symptoms of respiratory infection, even mild ones, was urged to avoid social contacts, both at work and in private, and throughout the country. On 16 March, the health authority (Folkh&auml;lsomyndigheten) recommended as much as possible isolating people over 70 and working from home. <br>Information not available	On 14 March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised against non-essential travel to all countries. <Br/>On 17 March, in response to the European Council's and the European Commission's call for travel restrictions, the government decided  to temporarily stop non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside the EEA and Switzerland, so as to mitigate the effects of the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and reduce the spread of the disease. The decision takes effect on 19 March and will initially apply for 30 days.	Many higher secondary schools (children aged over 16) and all universities have switched to distance learning as of 18 March. Schools for younger children are still open at this stage.	- Relatives should avoid "unnecessary visits" to hospitals and from 1 April, a ban on visiting elderly care institutions is imposed.<Br/><Br/>- Events with more than 50 persons are banned since 27 March. <Br/>	- The central government will compensate municipalities and regions for extraordinary measures and extra costs in health and medical care associated with the COVID-19 virus. On 2 April, the amount was raised to SEK 3bn from SEK 2bn. <Br/><Br/>- On 2 April, the government announced that grants to municipalities and regions will increase by SEK 20bn in 2020, up from SEK 5bn previously planned, of which SEK 12.5bn will be permanent. <Br/><Br/>- Sickness benefit to be paid for the first day of sickness.	The government has presented three comprehensive packages amounting to SEK 661.8 billion (about EUR 62.1 billion, nearly 13% of GDP), including liquidity provisions and credit guarantees if these are used by firms to the maximum.<br>On 25 March, the government announced another crisis package for small enterprises: <Br/>o Measures targeting small enterprises: 100% of the taxable profits of sole proprietors and partners in Swedish partnerships for 2019, up to SEK 1 million, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. VAT reported by sole proprietors annually from 27 December 2019 to 17 January 2021 will be eligible to deferral, with interest. These measures will provide a maximum liquidity reinforcement of more than SEK 20 billion.	- On 14 April, the Ministry of Finance announced a further reinforcement of its short-term layoffs scheme. From 1 May 2020 and for three months, employers will be able to reduce their employees' working hours by up to 80% (instead of 60%) and the government will bear most of the cost. The wage costs will be reduced by over 70% (previously 50%), while workers will retain almost 90% of their original wage. Combined with the reduced employers' social security contributions, employer costs can be reduced by up to 86% per cent during May and June. Control mechanisms will be enhanced.<Br/><Br/>- On 30 March, the government announced a new crisis package for jobs and transition<Br/>o Temporary reinforcement of unemployment insurance: eligibility conditions (length of employment and membership of a fund) will be temporarily relaxed; both the highest and the lowest amounts paid out by an unemployment insurance fund will be raised temporarily; the six initial qualifying days will be removed; the unemployment insurance funds will receive funding for administration.<Br/>o More active labour market policy: increased funding for the public employment service and labour market policy programmes; the period during which a person may have a subsidised job (extra job, new start job or introductory job) will be extended by an additional year for those who already have such jobs; the maximum time for support for starting a business will be extended from six to twelve months; municipalities will receive grants for more summer jobs for young people and funding for green jobs.<Br/>o More places and more distance learning at higher education institutions to benefit unemployed and people who are given notice of the termination of their contract.<Br/>o More opportunities for vocational education and training throughout the country. <Br/>o Removal of the income ceiling for student aid: the income ceiling for all those receiving student aid will be temporarily removed so that health and medical care students can help out in the health care sector without their student aid being reduced.<Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, the short-term layoffs scheme was introduced. Employees receive more than 90 per cent of their wages, but employers' wage costs can be halved, thanks to the government subsidy. The subsidy level is significantly higher than in the previous short-time work scheme (estimated cost: SEK 20 billion).<Br/><Br/>- Sickness benefit qualifying day is temporarily discontinued and the government will assume the entire cost of all sick pay during April and May.<Br/><Br/>- Self-employed persons will be entitled to receive standardised sick pay for 14 days.<br>Information not available	- On 25 March, the government announced another crisis package for small enterprises: <Br/>o Temporary reduction of employers' social security contributions to the old age pension contribution only for the period 1 March to 30 June 2020, up to 30 employees and on the portion of the employee's wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month. This entails tax relief of up to SEK 5 300 per employee per month. An equivalent relief applies to sole proprietors (estimated cost: SEK 33 billion).<Br/><Br/>- Postponement by 12 month of three month of preliminary income tax payments on salaries due between January and September 2020 (with interest charge)<Br/><Br/>- Liquidity reinforcement via tax accounts: companies can defer three months payment of employer social security contributions, preliminary tax on salaries and value added tax that are reported monthly or quarterly for up to 12 months, with interest. The new regulations take effect on 30 April, but can be retroactively applied from 1 January 2020. If companies use this opportunity to the same extent as in 2009, this would amount to SEK 27 billion. If all companies would use it to the maximum, this would amount to SEK 315 billion. To support SMEs, it will also be allowed to defer the value-added tax reported annually. Hence, companies can defer the payment of last year's VAT that is due shortly. If this is used to the maximum, it can amount to SEK 7 billion. In addition, SMEs can claim back the preliminary tax paid in 2019 and either pay it later or set it off against future losses (the maximum liquidity reinforcement could amount to SEK 13 billion). <br>Announced on 25 March: Temporary discount for rental costs in vulnerable sectors, such as durable consumer goods, hotels, restaurants and certain other activities, with the government covering 50% of the rental reduction up to 50% of the fixed rent (estimated cost: SEK 5 billion).<Br/><Br/>- On 20 March, the government announced support amounting to SEK 500 million (EUR 45 million ; 0.01% of GDP) for cultural activities that lose revenue as a result of the restriction on public events and the same amount for sports. <br>On 20 March, the government announced a new support package for small businesses: <Br/>o Almi, a state agency which offers loans to companies with growth potential and assists in their business development, will get a new capital grant of SEK 3 billion (about EUR 270 million, 0.06% of GDP) to allow it to lend more to SMEs.<Br/>o The Swedish Export Credit Agency's loan limit is extended to SEK 200 billion (about EUR 18 billion, 3.8% of GDP) from SEK 125 billion.<Br/>o The ceiling for credit guarantees from the agency which insures export companies and banks against the risk of non-payment in export transactions (EKN) is increased to SEK 500 billion (about EUR 45bn, 9.6% of GDP) from SEK 450 billion, the same amount as during the 2008 financial crisis, and the coverage is extended to encompass sea shipping. <br>- The Swedish Parliament has allowed the Government to issue credit guarantees of up to SEK 5 billion in 2020 for loans to airlines that on 1 January this year had a Swedish permit to operate commercial aviation and who have their main operations or headquarters in Sweden. <Br/><Br/>- On 25 March, the government announced another crisis package for small enterprises: <Br/>o Government guarantee on 70% of new bank loans to companies experiencing financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 virus but otherwise robust, up to SEK 75 million (with possible exceptions).<br>Information not available	- On 19 March, the Riksbank and the US Federal Reserve agreed on a swap facility of 60 billion USD. The agreement will be in place for at least six months.<Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, the Riksbank decided to increase purchases of securities by up to SEK 300 billion in 2020. Given relative scarcity of government bonds, purchases can include municipal and mortgage bonds (in the Nordics, there is a deep and liquid market for the latter) as well as non-financial corporate bonds and commercial papers. <Br/><br>- On 24 March, the FSA stressed that it expects credit institutions to stop this year's dividend payments and use the earnings to further strengthen their capital.<Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, FSA announced that it considers the loss of income associated with COVID-19 to qualify as a special reason that allows the bank and borrower to reach an agreement to reduce or suspend loan amortisation payments for a limited period of time.  FSA also clarified that it will temporarily allow banks to fall below the liquidity coverage ratio requirements for individual currencies and total currencies. This measure relieves liquidity constraints.<Br/><Br/>- On 13 March, the Riksbank has decided to lend up to SEK 500 billion (about 10% of GDP) (about &euro;46 billion) to companies via the banks, to avoid robust companies being knocked out as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. Banks will be allowed to borrow an unlimited amount at 3-month's maturity on a weekly basis against collateral at an interest rate of 20 bp above the repo rate. Flexibility will be increased on collateral requirements for banks when they borrow money from the Riksbank. <Br/><Br/>- On 13 March, Finansinspektionen (FSA) lowered its countercyclical capital buffer from 2.5% percentage points to 0%. This amounts to SEK 45 bn and should create a capacity of around SEK 900 billion (about 18% of GDP) for new lending. The FSA also announced that it will postpone all new investigations and on sight supervisory activities, in order to free up resources at the banks. <Br/>

All persons entitled to benefits receive a maximum of 120 additional daily allowances. The administrative procedures to apply for short-time work (part-time unemployment benefit) have been eased at short notice: i) the waiting period to benefit from this indemnity is eliminated until September 30, 2020 (against 2 days previously, the first days being borne by the company); ii) Employees no longer have to reduce their overtime before they can benefit from short-time compensation. iii)The approval period for short-time work is extended from 3 to 6 months.

Self-employed persons are not entitled to short-time work compensation. However, if they suffer a loss of income due to the closure of a business or the ban on events ordered under federal law, they are entitled to compensation amounting to 80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day. <br>Information not available	Businesses should have the possibility to extend payment deadlines without having to pay default interest. For this reason, the interest rate for VAT, customs duties, special excise taxes and incentive taxes will be reduced to 0.0 percent in the period from 21 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. No interest  will be charged during this period.   Companies affected by the crisis may be granted a temporary, interest-free deferral of payment of social security contributions. Companies also have the option of having the amount of the regular contributions adjusted if the sum of their wages has fallen significantly. The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.  <br>Further help is available for companies of the sport and event industry as well as in tourism.     <br>Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation and paid out quickly. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. <br>Information not available<br>Information not available	On March 19, the Central Bank (SNB) maintained its expansionary monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate and the interest rate on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75%. Moreover, the SNB announced it would provide liquidity as part of the extended swap arrangements with other central banks, particularly in US dollars. To ensure the provision of sufficient liquidity to the banking system, the SNB decided to raise the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system. <br>On March 25, the Confederation, the SNB and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authorities announced a package of measures together with the banks. In this context, the SNB is introducing the new SNB COVID-19 refinancing facility (CRF). This measure is aimed at strengthening the supply of credit to the Swiss economy by providing the banking system with additional liquidity. In these refinancing operations, the government-guaranteed bank loans serve as collateral. The CRF thus operates in conjunction with the federal government's guarantees for corporate loans. The setup is such that banks should be able to provide loans to small and medium enterprises within a day or two, starting March 26.On March 25, the SNB announced that it had recommended to the Confederation the deactivation of the anticyclical capital buffer. The deactivation should further enhance corporate credit supply by banks.
