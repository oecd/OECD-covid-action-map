Interstate travel is possible, but some individual states have introduced a requirement to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival and restrictions on non-essential travel. On 8 May, Australia's Commonwealth Government outlined a general plan for the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures. The intention is for the country to have moved to the third stage of the plan by July 2020. Most states and territories are currently in stage 2 of relaxing restrictions. This allows most businesses to reopen with physical distancing and new hygiene practices. Gyms, beauty therapists, cinemas, theatres, galleries, museums, have mostly reopened with restrictions on the size of gatherings depending on the individual state or territory. 	1	"Only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. From 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020, only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days. From 28 March, all travellers arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14 day self-isolation at designated facilities. On 24 March, it was announced that Australians are not allowed to take a return trip overseas, unless in exceptional circumstances (in mid-June, the ban was extended and will now run until 17 September). Cruise ships from foreign ports have been banned. From 18 May, Western Australia relaxed some restrictions on movements within the state. Borders in some states have closed to interstate visitors. Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory all have closed borders, but several states have announced plans for reopening. For example, Queensland and South Australia will reopen borders from July 10 and July 20 respectively. 	5	Primary school and high school students have now returned to face to face learning. In some states and territories, university and adult education students are still being urged to work from home where possible. 	1	Most states and territories are now in stage 2 of relaxing restrictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, the maximum permitted size of gatherings varies between 20 people and 100 people. In most states, restaurants, museums, galleries, playgrounds, places of worship, pools and gyms are open, albeit with slightly altered operations to allow for physical distancing and stricter hygiene standards. 	0	Information not available	1	Total direct spending by Commonwealth Government of A$134bn (6.7% of GDP) and by State Governments of around A$30bn (1.5% of GDP). 	8.2	Total direct spending by Commonwealth and State Governments amounts to approximately A$164bn.	"On 11 March, the Government committed an additional A$2.4 billion to support the health system to manage any further outbreak in Australia. The package provided support across primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the National Medical Stockpile, along with a national communication campaign. The package also provided funding to ensure Australia had sufficient personal protective equipment and medicines in addition to infection control training and programs for health and aged care workers.<Br/>On 15 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced that health services had moved into the 'Targeted Action' stage of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This included moving resources within hospitals to priority areas, establishing fever clinics which specialise in COVID-19, cancelling non-urgent elective surgeries to free up capacity in public hospitals and adapting hospital resources (i.e. rooms and equipment) for use in priority areas, such as Intensive Care Units. <Br/>On 29 March, the Prime Minister announced an additional A$1.1 billion in funding for mental health services, domestic violence support, Medicare assistance for people at home (including through telehealth services) and emergency food relief.<Br/>On 31 March, the Government announced a partnership with private health providers for their infrastructure, essential equipment, supplies, workforce and additional resources to be made available to the public health system. In return, the government would ensure the viability of these enterprises. In essence, this agreement will integrate the private and public health systems in the event that capacity in the public system is strained. <Br/>On 26 April, the government launched the new voluntary app, COVIDSafe. It is intended that the app will help with tracking and tracing COVID-19 infections. <Br/>On 27 April, the first phase in reinstating elective surgeries commenced. Since then, there has been further reintroduction of elective surgery across states and territories. <Br/>	0.3	A$5bn	"On 30 March, the Commonwealth Government announced a planned wage subsidy to businesses (A$130bn or 6&frac12;% of GDP) to encourage them to keep workers in jobs. A &ldquo;JobKeeper Payment&rdquo; of A$1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee is being paid to businesses under the condition that every eligible employee receives at least A$ 1,500 per fortnight from the business. By end May 2020, the estimated costing of the scheme had been revised down to A$70 bn (3.5% of GDP). The Jobkeeper Payment covers full-time and part-time employees, as well as employees stood down ahead of the commencement of the scheme, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months and the self employed. Eligible businesses are those with a turnover of less than A$1 billion that can demonstrate a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable month one year ago (firms with turnover of greater than A$1 billion must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in turnover). The programme commenced 30 March, with the first payments being received by eligible businesses in the first week of May as monthly arrears from the Australian Taxation Office.<Br/>There has been a temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight.  This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. The supplement will be paid for the next six months.<Br/>Social security and veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders can receive up to two separate cash payments of $750 (those who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive the second cash payment of A$750). <Br/>The government has also announced some relaxation of the partner income test for employees applying for unemployment benefits and the Coronavirus Supplement of A$550 per fortnight. An individual can now receive these benefits as long as their partner earns less than A$79,762 per annum (the threshold was previously less than A$48k). <Br/>On April 2, a subsidy to childcare providers was announced, conditional on them staying open and not charging families for care. The Commonwealth Government will pay 50 per cent of the sector's fee revenue up to the existing hourly rate cap. The funding will apply from 6 April based on the number of children who were in care during the fortnight leading into 2 March, whether or not they are attending services. The existing arrangements will end in mid-July and be replaced by a three month A$708 million support package to the childcare sector. Families will return to paying for childcare, with the reintroduction of the Child Care Subsidy, but the criteria for families impacted by the economic downturn will be loosened. <Br/>Some labour market regulations have also been temporarily relaxed for the duration of the crisis. Across a large range of work types (103 of the 121 modern awards), employees will receive two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave. The covered employees will also be allowed to take double the duration of annual leave at half pay. There have also been changes to three specific awards that cover about 2 million workers, those related to restaurants, hospitality and the clerks award. These changes will allow an individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification perform another type of duty in another type of classification.<Br/>	4.7	A$93bn	New Commonwealth Government measures include support for business investment, including by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access to this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures. Measures have also been implemented to support business cash flows (including through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). <Br/><Br/><Br/>	1.86	A$38bn	Information not available	--		On 12 March, the Australian Taxation Office announced a range of measures to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). These have been complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits.<Br/>The government has also announced the HomeBuilder programme to support residential construction activity in the second half of 2020. The programme will provide all eligible owner-occupiers with a grant of A$25,000 to build a new home or substantially renovate an existing home. Construction must be contracted to commence within three months of the contract date. Applicants are subject to eligibility criteria, including caps on household income and the price of a new home or renovation. The program is expected to provide around 27,000 grants at a total cost of around $680 million.<Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government is guaranteeing 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility is A$40bn (2% of GDP). Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, businesses with up to A$10mn in total loan facilities will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.	2	A$40bn	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent); 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent; 3) the introduction of a A$90bn (4.5% of GDP) term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses; 4) Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/>	On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  	0.1	A$2bn	On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants. On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.	--		Information not available	Information not available

Among others, the transfer will benefit 6 million of female-headed single parent families. The estimated fiscal cost is 1.3% of GDP. Additional spending of 0.04% of GDP on the conditional cash transfer programme Bolsa Familia aims at a rapid reduction of waiting lines for programme enrolment and could imply up to 1 million of additional beneficiaries. Formal workers and their employers can benefit from a new short-time work scheme with public income support from unemployment insurance. Benefit levels are 80% of earnings for those earning 1 minimum wage and capped at 1.8 minimum wages. All benefits are pro-rated for the reduction of working hours of the worker, which can be 25%, 50%, 70% or 100% in the case of suspension. The estimated fiscal cost is around 0.7% of GDP. Withdrawals from individual unemployment insurance accounts will become possible as of mid-June.

This is a loan over 36 months, with a grace period of 6 months, and a nominal interest rate below current inflation. Payments are directly disbursed into workers' accounts, but firms are liable for the debt. 85% of the credit risk is borne by the federal government	--	34000000000	The policy rate Selic was cut on three occasions, by 50 bps on 18/3 to 3.75% by 75 bps on 06/5, to 3.00% and by 75 bps to 2.25% on 17/6. 	The Central Bank is injecting liquidity worth 17% of GDP, to be implemented through lower reserve and capital requirements and special liquidity lines for banks.

Replaced by epidemic emergency until 14 June with most preventative measures still in place.	1	On June 1, Bulgaria made exempt from a 14-day quarantine people coming from several EU countries, and a few non-EU countries. The mandatory 14-day quarantine on entry to Bulgaria is applicable for people coming from the UK, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Malta, Italy and all non-EU countries except Serbia and North Macedonia. On May 22, Bulgaria lifted the entry ban on citizens of EU member states, the United Kingdom, Schengen visa zone member countries (including the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Andorra, the Principality of Monaco and the Vatican City State), the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of North Macedonia.

Nightclubs remain closed until end of pandemic emergency (June 14).	1	Budget measures amount to about BGN 1.5 billion (1.3% of GDP). The 60:40 measure is the most important tool (around BGN 1 billion) designed to support businesses in the crisis. The budget measures were part of the package approved under the Law on the amendment of the 2020 State Budget Act (approved by partliament on April 6). In addition, there has been a reprogramming of resources from EU funds to programmes to support individuals and enterprises directly affected by the crisis amounting to BGN 870 million. There also has been a BGN 700 million capital increase of the Bulgarian Development Bank, and a package of Government-supported financial instruments in the form of liquidity provision/guarantees (BGN 4.5 billion). This brings the overall stimulus package to around 5.8% of 2019 GDP.	1.25526313475239	1.51	Doctors and nurses working in the frontline will receive an additional payment of BGN 1000 a month (EUR 510) (announced on 15 March).

The state also covers 60% of the social security and healthcare contributions, rather than the employers and employees covering such contributions in full. This covers companies (i) engaged in retail (with the exception of car or motorcycle dealerships), land and air transportation, hotels, restaurants and bars, cinemas, tourist operators and trade fair organisers, private kindergartens, artistic and other cultural activities, sports and other recreational activities; and (ii) companies that have experienced a 20 per cent fall in sales in March 2020, compared to the same month of 2019. Firms need to retain all their staff to qualify. Expenditure is estimated to reach BGN 1 billion (EUR 510 million). Employers were able to apply for the scheme with the Employment Agency on 31 March (with decision to take up to 7 days and then compensation within 5 days). An amendment on 30 May establishes that  employers must pay remuneration to employees that is not less than the amount of the employees' social insurance income in January 2020. Initially, the scheme was set to be in place until the end of the State of Emergency and was then extended to 30 June. The Government is considering plans for the continuation of this type programme beyond July.	0.831300089239996	1	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Certain taxes and fees due to government have been delayed, including the deadline for submission of the annual income tax return and for payment of the tax assessed has been extended until end-June firms/sole traders involved in commerce and farmers who pay tax under this regime. 	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	A government-backed package of financial instruments has been put in place to the amount of BGN 4.5 billion. (i) The capital of the Bulgarian Development Bank (BDB) was increased by BGN 700 million of which BGN 500 million will be used to issue portfolio guarantees (with 80% coverage of loan principal) to commercial banks to enable them to provide more flexible business unsecured loans for a specified period under certain conditions and individual case-by-case assessment. This was part of the package approved under the Law on the amendment of the 2020 State Budget Act (approved by partliament on April 6). The guarantees period is 5 years. The amount of loans is up to BGN 300,000 provided by commercial banks, the volume of the program is BGN 2 billion and is accessible to all business sectors in all regions of Bulgaria. Eligible borrowers are micro as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in accordance with the SME Law. It is expected that sectors most affected by the crisis will benefit from the instrument, mainly trade, transport, hotels and restaurant, logistics, also export-orient companies and others. The grace period for payment of interest and principal is up to 36 months. Application deadline for the program is by the end of 2020. The eligibility criteria are:<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Decrease in turnover starting the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 (based on the financial statements of the company);<Br/><Br/>- Existence of receivables from customers that have not been received / amounts not paid to suppliers after 01.03.2020 (based on the financial statements of the company);<Br/><Br/>- Discontinued import supplies required for the enterprise's activity <Br/>- after 01.01.2020, cancelled export contracts (based on certificates and documents submitted by the company);<Br/><Br/>- Sickness and self-isolation of employees, overall reduction in the number of employees, closed production facilities and offices (based on certificates and documents provided by the company).<Br/>The remaining BGN 200 mln will guarantee interest-free consumer loans with the amount of BGN 1500 <Br/>- 4500. The maximum amount of BGN 4500 could be drawn at one time or in three tranches of BGN 1500 each. If a smaller amount of the loan is initially allowed, it can be annexed subsequently in order to reach the amount of BGN 4500. So far 12 commercial banks have declared interest in participating in this measure. The lending decisions under those programs will depend on the banks and remain market-based. No fees, commissions or penalties will be due for the loans.<Br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (ii) The Government also activated financial instruments with a public resource through the Fund Manager (the Fund of funds). The main role of the Fund is to implement financial instruments in Bulgaria via facilities using EU funds and private resources. The financial instruments financed from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIFs) are specialised funding schemes where the Fund of Funds provides financing, via financial intermediaries and banks, in the form of guarantees, loans and equity investments to various target groups of final recipients. In the current exceptional circumstances, the Fund is focusing efforts on several main areas:                                                                                                               <Br/><Br/>- Loans to provide liquidy support to SMEs <Br/>- One of the measures is a guarantee product that provides liquidity support to small and medium-sized enterprises operating in various sectors, including those most affected by the crisis, such as tourism, transport, wholesale and retail trade, etc. The Fund of Funds will provide banks with guarantees totalling to BGN 170 million that will back up new loans of up to BGN 850 million in terms of one year. The amount of financing is up to BGN 3.6 million, mainly for working capital, with the possibility of providing long-term investment loans up to a maximum of ten years. The goal is to enable such lending without any additional administrative burden for the loan applicants. In addition, an extended grace period for the principal amounts is envisaged. <Br/><Br/><Br/>- Micro loans programme <Br/>- this measure provides support to self-employed individuals and small start-ups having a very short business track record, if any, including those set up by vulnerable groups (people with disabilities, young people aged 29 or less, people who have been unemployed for more than 6 months). This is a facility for granting concessional loans, including without any collateral, to target groups of final recipients who usually have no access to bank financing due to a lack of credit history. The aim of the instrument is to retain employment levels by supporting small businesses, including those run by self-employed persons. The amount available for this measure totals BGN 24 mln, with the possibility of supplying additional funds, should the facility be exhausted rapidly. The loans are extended via financial intermediaries that have capacity and branch networks in all of the 28 districts of Bulgaria. Eligible undertakings could receive up to BGN 50 000 leva in working capital loans funds and investments under more favourable conditions and at interest terms below market rates.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Funds for private equity in start-ups and innovative companies -this measure is in the field of venture equity investments in start-ups and innovative businesses, and amounts to BGN 150 million This instrument is designed to support companies that have the potential to contribute in the rapid economic recovery after the crisis, especially in key areas of innovation and digitalization, as well as make investments in high tech such as bio and nanotechnology, mechatronics, green technology and IT, pharmaceuticals, fintech, where such investments can bring added value. Considering that start-ups and fast-growing companies are facing so far unpredictable challenges, the Fund of Funds is focusing its efforts mainly on accelerating investments and providing more favourable conditions. The amount of investment varies over a wide range according to the stage of development of the companies. The average value is BGN 800 thousand in the form of equity investments, i.e. investments in the capital of the companies or convertible debt in return for which the investor is entitled to acquire participation in the capital of the company under certain conditions.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Funds for urban development <Br/>- the Fund will continue to finance municipal and other projects aimed at improving the urban environment, with a facility amounting to BGN 418 million available through its urban development funds. This financial instrument is targeted at 39 Bulgarian municipalities and public and private urban development projects. This support is for infrastructure projects, cultural centers and tourist objects with national and global importance, development of economic zones which is key for the economy in times of crisis, given the lack of financing alternatives on the market. It is envisaged to further ease the conditions in the direction of greater guarantee coverage, as well as for projects and companies in the most affected sectors of the crisis such as tourism and transport. The amount of financing can reach up to BGN 40 million and is mainly aimed at investments, with the possibility of providing also working capital financing.	Information not available	Information not available	There is a currency board in place since July 1997 that fixes the national currency to the euro. The ECB and the BNB put in place a swap line of EUR 2 billion to be put in place until end-2020 to provide euro liquidity (announced 22 April 2020).	The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) is taking measures aimed at both preserving the stability of the banking system and strengthening its flexibility to reduce the adverse effects on households and companies from the restrictions caused by the pandemic (announced on 19 March). The key measures include an increase in banking system liquidity with BGN 7 billion or 5.9% of 2019 GDP by reducing commercial banks' foreign exposures, full capitalisation of profits in the banking system (BGN 1.6 billion), and the cancellation of the counter-cyclical capital buffer increase planned for 2020 and 2021 (totalling 0.6% of 2019 GDP). BNB package of measures in relation to the COVID 19 pandemic amounts to total BGN 9.3 billion.

Some areas are fully locked down. People aged 75 or older must stay at home and the government issued a recommendation to stay at home to everyone.	2	Borders are open to nationals and residents only, subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine upon arrival.	3	Schools and universities are closed (starting on March 16). Winter holidays were brought forward.	5	Events of more than 50 people are banned from March 16. Public venues as well as restaurants, bars, and the like are closed.	2	Information not available	1	The Government of Chile announced several measures in response to the pandemic. First, the government has ensured fiscal resources for detection and treatment of the virus. Second, policy measures have been geared towards supporting household incomes, especially for the most vulnerable, and protecting employment. Third, a broad set of measures point towards injecting liquidity to the economy, thereby facilitating access to working capital, especially for SMEs. A national agreement achieved between the the government and political parties leads to a new emergency plan to support the economy for the forthcoming two years. Its main pillars are: i) protecting households' income and well-being, with a new emergency family plan, a new solidarity fund at the municipal level, a new health fund, and some improvements to the employment protection law and unemployment insurance scheme ii) a reactivation plan for the economy and the labour market, which includes a public investment plan, hiring subsidies, easing the financing of SMEs, promoting private investment, new teleworking measures, facilitating access to credit and supporting public companies iii) the creation of a new US $12,000 million fund to finance the recovery plan, to be financed partly by sovereign wealth funds. 	6.7	$16.7 billion	- A national campaign was launched to inform the public of prevention measures and detection.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- As of April 1, the coordination of the public and private network was handed over to the Undersecretary of Healthcare Networks. This means that the Ministry of Health took control of the management of public and private infrastructure to face this emergency.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Testing for people covered by the National Health Fund is free (subject to a prescription). Price for people covered by private insurers is capped. Between March and May, the daily capacity of PCR tests was almost quadrupled.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Hospital capacity will be reinforced by speeding up the completion of five new hospitals and other facilities, such as a field hospital, 6 health care posts, a navy ship and a new field hospital with a capacity of 3 thousand beds in a convention center, among others.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Between March and June, ICU beds with mechanical fans will be doubled.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Bed capacity for people who must be quarantined will be increased. The government announced on May 17 the expansion of the existing network of Health Residences nationwide to accommodate people in need, with special concern and priority for the elderly.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Elective surgeries will be postponed in cases where delay does not imply a significant health risk. <Br/><Br/><Br/>- The National Health Procurement Agency will accelerate the delivery of personal protection equipment for emergency services and primary health care staff.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Workers that have been in contact with confirmed cases are granted a sick-leave.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- The Ministry of Health authorized the performance of synchronous care in 11 medical specialties. While the Health Alert is in force, these medical consultations may be carried out remotely in the same terms as face-to-face care, through information technology and telecommunications between a patient and a doctor who are in different geographical locations and who they can interact with each other in real time.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- The government instructed health insurance institutions to deliver medications at home to patients diagnosed with any of the 85 pathologies guaranteed by the state, without this implying an additional cost. The measure aims to prevent the displacement of these patients to obtain the dispensing of their prescriptions.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- To cope with the effects of the pandemic and the confinement in the mental health of the population, the government announced on May 17 the Healthy-Mind program. This program will strengthen the public and private offer of mental health and will include a digital platform for consultation, support and recommendations on this matter.<Br/>	--		- The 19th of April the government gave a cash transfer (Bono Covid) for the poorest families (2 million households).<Br/><Br/><Br/>- The 14th of May the government enacted a bill for a second transfer, covering people from the 60% poorest population and without formal work (about 4.9 million people). This will be provided for a period of three months. <Br/><Br/><Br/>- The 17th of May the government announced the delivery of 2.5 million family baskets with food and essential elements for middle-class and vulnerable families in this emergency due to problems in supplying themselves.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- The law for job protection, covering 4.5 million formal workers, has now come into force, which allows the temporary suspension of employees&acute; functions in the company when the employee must remain at home without the possibility of teleworking.

The regional council announced that it will go ahead with the election plans, which will be held before the end of Ethiopian year (September 11, 2020). Further, the Council also extended the regional State of Emergency by two and half months, despite the COVID-19 five-month state of emergency order in place at the federal level. <Br/>*June 8: Ethiopian PM addressed the parliament and touched on various issues related to COVID-19 and supported the decision not to halt EA flights to China and other countries. He also defended the Government's decision not to enforce strict lockdowns, and claimed measures to contain the virus should be based on local realities. <Br/>*April 24: The northern (Tigray) region of Ethiopia has eased the State of Emergency and lockdown measures. Under the new conditions civil servants will be returning to work and movements within the region will be allowed. Other activities will be allowed under strict social distancing measures (i.e only take-away services will be allowed for restaurants and bars).                    <Br/>*The region also implemented a 14 day mandatory quarantine for any passengers arriving via the regional airpot and land. 	3	*March 23: The authorities have closed borders.<Br/>	3	*March 16: Schools have been shut down.	4	*June 10: General elections meant to reconstitute a new parliament and originally to take place on August 29 have been postponed until international health institutions have deemed the threat from coronavirus to be over.

The reading of the regional budget is normally a joint exercise among member countries. It is expected that COVID-19 has put extra  pressure on government budgets, due to reduction in fiscal revenues and deterioration of economic outlook. East African fiscal finances are expected to have bigger deficits than what was expected few months ago and public debt is expected to increase at faster rate. However, authorities are expected to carefully monitor their budgets to avoid deficit, and allocate fiscal resources where necessary, including health care, and social support sectors. <Br/>*May 29: A supplementary budget of USD 1.43 billion has been approved by the parliament, for the fiscal year 2019/20. The budget aims to support humanitarian and medical assistance and to reduce the economic ramification of Covid19, for the estimated 30 million people who are considered to be in need of government assistance. The budget will be funded by a mix of loans from internal and external sources. <Br/>*March 23: the Prime Minister announced the aid package announced earlier on would be increased to Br 5 billion (US$154 million or 0.15 percent of GDP) but details on the precise modalities of the assistance are not yet available.                                                                                                                                            *Early March: Ethiopia initially announced a Br 300 million package to bolster healthcare spending. <Br/>*April 3: The GOE announced the Multi-Sectoral Preparedness and Response Plan, to be implemented over 3 months.

EU	ECO	16-Jun-2020	16-Jun-2020	55	4.5	European Union	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	On March 17, EU Member States agreed to restrict non-essential travel to the European Union for an initial period of 30 days. The Commission subsequently recommended to extend restrictions three times, until 30 June. Exceptions mainly cover EU and British citizens, long-time residents, cross-border commuters, health care workers and workers delivering goods. Movement of goods is not to be affected. On June 11, the Commission proposed a coordinated lifting of restrictions from 1 July, starting with a common list of third countries selected together by Member States.  For the remaining third countries, the Commission proposed to enlarge the categories of permitted travellers to include, for instance, international students.	3	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	* The EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII; proposed on 13 March, in force since 1 April) will accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April and in force since 24 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April). Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.<Br/><Br/>* At the request of Member States, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/><Br/>*   EUR 1 billion has been provided as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing (announced on 13 March, implemented on 6 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 9 April, EU finance ministers decided to establish Pandemic Crisis Support credit lines within the framework of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Access granted will be 2% of the respective country's GDP as of end-2019, as a benchmark (about &euro;240 billion in total). The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. The only requirement to access the credit line is that euro area Member States requesting support would commit to use this credit line to finance direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis. On 8 May, the Eurogroup agreed on further details: requests for Pandemic Crisis Support may be made until end-2022 (with the possibility to adjust this deadline) and the ensuing loans to countries will have a maximum average maturity of 10 years and favourable pricing modalities. On May 15, the Board of Governors of the ESM approved the establishment of Pandemic Crisis Support.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission adopted on 19 March a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules. This Framework was extended on 3 April, and then on 8 May, to cover additional types of aid. It will be in place until end-2020 (for recapitalisation measures, until end of June 2021).<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced on 16 March a plan (currently being deployed) to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.<Br/><Br/>* In addition to the above plan, EU finance ministers endorsed on 9 April an EIB proposal to create a EUR 25 billion guarantee fund, which will support up to EUR 200 billion of financing for companies (especially SMEs) throughout the EU. The scheme will be implemented by the EIB Group, in close partnership with national promotional banks and other financial intermediaries. By guaranteeing parts of loan portfolios, operations under the guarantee fund will free up capital for the financial intermediaries involved to make further financing available for SMEs and mid-caps. On 26 May, the Board of Directors of the EIB agreed on the structure and business model of this new <Br/>Pan-European Guarantee Fund. The fund will initially approve operations until end-2021 (a deadline which can be extended), and at least 65% of the financing will go to SMEs.<Br/><Br/>* The Commission presented on 2 April a proposal for a new European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE). SURE support will take the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States, to help them cover the costs directly related to the creation or extension of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures for the self-employed, in the context of the current crisis. EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. An instrument along these lines was endorsed by EU finance ministers on 9 April. On May 20, a Regulation establishing SURE entered into force. Countries will be able to use loans also in support of some health-related measures, esp. in the workplace. SURE will become available once all Member States have provided the required guarantees proportionally to gross national income, and will remain available until end-2022 (with the possibility to adjust this deadline).<Br/><Br/>* On 27 May the European Commission presented its proposal of a recovery plan of EUR 750 billion (about 5.5% of EU27 2019 GDP). This plan, named Next Generation EU, is embedded within the 2021-27 EU budget, strengthening some of the previously proposed budget programmes and creating new instruments. It envisages 3 strands of support over the next 4 years (2021-2024):<Br/>1. Support to Member States with investments and reforms<Br/><Br/>- A new Recovery and Resilience Facility to help finance investment and reforms in line with the priorities of the European Semester (EUR 560 billion, of which EUR 310 billion in grants and EUR 250 billion in loans)<Br/><Br/>- A new REACT-EU initiative, providing a top-up to current cohesion policy programmes, to be spent until 2022 (EUR 50 billion)<Br/><Br/>- A reinforcement of the Just Transition Fund, which will support the transition to climate neutrality (EUR 30 billion)<Br/><Br/>- A reinforcement of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EUR 15 billion)<Br/>2. Kick-starting the EU economy by incentivising private investments<Br/><Br/>- A new Solvency Support Instrument, aiming to mobilise private resources to support viable firms in the sectors, regions and countries most affected (EUR 26 billion of guarantees)<Br/><Br/>- A reinforcement of InvestEU, the main EU investment programme, including a new Strategic Investment Facility to generate investments in boosting the resilience of strategic sectors and key value chains in the internal market (EUR 30.3 billion of guarantees)<Br/>3. Addressing the lessons of the crisis<Br/><Br/>- New or reinforced programmes in the areas of health, R&D, civil protection and external action, including humanitarian aid (EUR 38.7 billion) <Br/>Overall, the plan envisages EUR 250 billion of loans, about EUR 50 billion of guarantees and almost EUR 450 billion of grants, with a focus on the sectors and regions most severely affected by the pandemic. The plan will be financed through borrowing by the Commission on financial markets, which entails temporarily increasing the Own Resources ceiling (the maximum amount of funds that the EU can request from Member States to cover its financial obligations) by 0.6% of EU gross national income. However, this acts like a guarantee, and should not entail actual additional disbursements by Member States over 2021-27 (in this period, even the borrowing costs for the grant component of the Plan will be paid by the EU budget). Repayment will take place through future EU budgets between 2028 and 2058. This will entail increased contributions by Member States and/or new own resources, which could be related to carbon emissions or include a digital tax. The Commission will present detailed proposals of additional own resources at a later stage.<Br/>	Information not available	Information not available	* The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry.<Br/><Br/>* On 19 March, the Commission decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile was EUR 50 million, subsequently increased to EUR 80 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.<Br/><Br/>* On 2 April, the Commission presented a legislative proposal (in force since 15 April) to activate and extend the scope of the Emergency Support Instrument, with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget to directly purchase or procure emergency support on behalf of Member States, financially support and co-ordinate pressing needs such as the transportation of medical equipment and of patients in cross-border regions, and support the construction of mobile field hospitals.<Br/><Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		* The ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o 12 March: lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o 12 March: conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o 18 March, further detailed on 7 April: easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework. These measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, include expanding the use of credit claims as collateral, reducing collateral valuation haircuts and taking a number of other temporary steps, such as a waiver to accept Greek sovereign debt instruments as collateral.<Br/>o 22 April: adopting temporary measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades. More specifically, the ECB will grandfather the eligibility of marketable assets and the issuers of such assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 in the event of downgrades, as long as the ratings remain at or above BB.<Br/>o 30 April: reducing further the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) until June 2021, to 50 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/>o 30 April: conducting a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). These will consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o 12 March: adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o 18 March: furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o 18 March: expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. <Br/>o 4 June: increasing the envelope for the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) by EUR 600 billion to a total of EUR 1350 billion, and extending the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021. Furthermore, the maturing principal payments from PEPP purchases will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022.	* Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities (12 March). In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March), and announced a temporary reduction in capital requirements for market risk (16 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 28 April, the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation (EU) 575/2013) to provide temporary capital relief to banks. These changes include inter alia extending by 2 years the current transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital, a later date of application of the leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important institutions, a more favourable treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the NPL prudential backstop (the minimum loss coverage requirement for non-performing loans), and advancing the date of application of capital reduction factors in respect of certain loans to SMEs or in support of infrastructure investments.

On the 14 of April, the Reserve Bank decided a further cut of 100 basis points to 4.25% of the repo rate. // ii. Monetary policy rates: On the 19th of March the Reserve Bank decided to cut the repo rate from 6.25 to 5.25%. <Br/>iii. liquidity injections: On March 20, the Reserve Bank announced three measures to ease money market liquidity:<Br/>1. Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations: The SARB will, through its Open Market Operations Desk, conduct Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations (IOSROs) to provide intraday liquidity support to clearing banks, except on Wednesdays, when the main repurchase transaction is conducted. IOSROs will be carried out through a fixed-rate auction with a pro-rata allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the repurchase (repo) rate. <Br/>2. Weekly Main Refinancing Operations: The additional money market liquidity provided to clearing banks via the IOSROs will result in the current money market shortage (MMS) declining below the current target level of R56 billion. The size of the Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) will be kept at R56 billion and increased if necessary.<Br/>3. Standing Facilities:  The Standing Facilities (SF) borrowing rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB absorbs liquidity <Br/>- will be adjusted to the repo rate less 200 basis points, from the current repo rate less 100 basis points. The SARB deems this change necessary in order to encourage the flow of money market liquidity. The SF lending rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB provides liquidity to the commercial banks <Br/>- will be adjusted lower to the repo rate, from the prevailing rate of the repo rate plus 100 basis points. This will support banks to facilitate their flow of money market liquidity without being penalised. 	1) The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of banks has been reduced from 100% to 80% (Directive 1 of 2020); 2) Temporary capital relief is provided in a manner which still complies with international standards. The Regulations provide that banks shall have in place robust policies, processes and procedures to ensure that the bank continuously maintains, in addition to the base minimum capital requirement of eight per cent of risk weighted assets, a systemic risk capital requirement (Pillar 2A), an idiosyncratic risk capital requirement (Pillar 2b), a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical buffer (CCyB) and a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) buffer. Both the CCyB and D-SIB buffers, when imposed, are an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The relief provided is that the Pillar 2A requirement is reduced to zero. South Africa has not implemented the countercyclical capital buffers as there has not been an excess aggregate credit extension thus banks are not required to maintain capital for systemic risk. Banks have built up a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent stipulated in terms of Regulation 38(8)(e)(D) hence banks are permitted to draw down from this buffer in this period of financial distress. the relief in response to the Covid-19 pandemic for banks to extend credit in the real economy and not for banks to distribute dividends. The Pillar 2A capital requirement will be re-imposed on banks after the financial stress period as will be directed by the PA. (Directive 2 of 2020). 3) The PA issued Directive 3 of 2020, which signals approval of the actions taken by banks to assist borrowers. This includes selected short-term payment holidays and loan restructures. The PA is providing credit risk capital relief to banks. Loans had to be up to date on 29 February 2020 in order to qualify for the relief. Retail (which include residential mortgage advances, retail revolving credit, SME retail and retail other) and corporate (which include corporate, SME corporate and the various specialised lending asset classes) would be able to qualify. A)Prudential authority issued a proposal on March 26 effective from April 1st, which includes dropping minimum capital requirements and compulsory reserve funds for lenders, reducing the liquidity coverage ratio to 80% from 100% and relaxing accounting standards when determining potential losses.
