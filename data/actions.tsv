An individual can now receive these benefits provided that their partner earns less than A$79,762 per annum (the threshold was previously less than A$48k). <Br/>On April 2, a subsidy to childcare providers was announced, conditional on them staying open and not charging families for care. The Commonwealth Government will pay 50 per cent of the sector's fee revenue up to the existing hourly rate cap. The funding will apply from 6 April based on the number of children who were in care during the fortnight leading into 2 March, whether or not they are attending services. <Br/>Some labour market regulations have also been temporarily relaxed for the duration of the crisis. Across a large range of work types (103 of the 121 modern awards), employees will receive two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave. The covered employees will also be allowed to take double the duration of annual leave at half pay. There have also been changes to three specific awards that cover about 2 million workers, those related to restaurants, hospitality and the clerks award. These changes will allow an individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification perform another type of duty in another type of classification.<Br/>	7.6	A$152.9bn	New Commonwealth Government measures include support for business investment, including by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access to this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures. Measures have also been implemented to support business cash flows (including through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). <Br/><Br/><Br/>	1.9	A$37bn	Information not available	--		On 12 March, the Australian Taxation Office announced a range of measures to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). These have been complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits. 	--		Information not available	--		Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government will guarantee 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility will be A$40bn (2% of GDP). Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, businesses with up to A$10mn in total loan facilities will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.	2	A$40bn	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent); 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent; 3) the introduction of a A$90bn (4.5% of GDP) term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses; 4) Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/>	On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  	0.1	A$2bn	On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants. On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.	--		Information not available	Information not available

Austrian authorities have signaled to mobilize additional help if needed. <Br/><Br/>* The budget envelope consists of the following items, which are already implemented or soon to be implemented:<Br/>o Emergency funds for hard-hit industries which provides direct liquidity provisions and subsidies for running costs (EUR 15 billion).<Br/>o Credit guarantees (up to EUR 9 billion).<Br/>o Tax deferrals (up to EUR 10 billion) for personal income and corporate income taxes. Taxes can be deferred until end of September.

Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border and a further 30% from the Slovak Republic. Slovaks, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. <Br/><Br/>For the moment, the government has introduced two immediate measures for the 460.000 persons in need of care. Firstly, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional Civilian Servants can be mobilized this way. Secondly, federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for mobile and stationary care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments. Lower Austria flied in 231 care-takes directly from Bulgaria and Romania. From May on, train traffic through Hungary for Romanian care-takers will be resumed.<Br/><Br/>From April 1 on, the government has introduced further measures to contain the propagation of the virus. Wearing masks is now mandatory in open spaces, including supermarkets. Vulnerable people have to work from home. <Br/><Br/>The government has started testing representative samples of Austrians for infection with Covid-19. A first test with 2,197 Austrians suggested a rather low rate of infection (around 1% of total population). Further testing with larger samples are planned in the near future.<Br/>	--		* All workers (private and public sector) can be requested to use all remaining leave days from last year and to deplete any over-time hours.  <Br/><Br/>* Short-time working (EUR 5 billion): The Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) takes over the salary of all workers (except public service) including apprentices of min. 10% up to 90% of the working time according to collective bargaining agreements up to a certain threshold (100% for apprentices). This threshold depends on gross salary and is 90% for salaries below EUR 1,700, 85% for salaries below EUR 2,685 and 80% for salaries below EUR 5,370; apprentices will be compensated in full. Any application to the short-time working scheme will be handled within 48h. The employer's share of social security contributions is covered as well.<Br/><Br/>* The Ministry of Finance will take over one third of labour costs for workers who have to take care of children up to an age of 14 due to closed schools or kindergartens.<Br/><Br/>* Short-time working is limited to three months with the possibility to reapply for another three months.<Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Swift support measures (up to EUR 4 billion)<Br/><Br/>* Self-employed and micro-sized enterprises (< 10 employees) are supported by EUR 2 billion.<Br/><Br/>* A single entity can tap up to EUR 6,000 within three months.<Br/><Br/>Credit guarantees (of up to EUR 9 billion)<Br/><Br/>* Around EUR 2 billion is provided through an export credit scheme and intends to cover up to 15 % of operating costs of exporting companies. <Br/><Br/>* General liquidity provisions are granted by the Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (aws), a federal development and financing bank. <Br/><Br/>* The aws supports firms of all sizes in all industries except the tourism sector, which is covered by the public Tourism bank. The funds for general liquidity provisions by the public Tourism bank will be stepped up to EUR 1 billion (from EUR 100 million).<Br/><Br/>* Self-employed can tap the credit guarantees as well. <Br/><Br/>* The aws covers only credits necessary to preserve liquidity but does not cover debt restructurings. <Br/><Br/>* The minister of Finance has been entitled to increase the guarantee envelope with a sunset clause of three months. <Br/><Br/>Emergency assistance (EUR 15 billion) <Br/><Br/>* The emergency assistance intends to support industries hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and will provide direct liquidity provisions and subsidies for operating costs. <Br/><Br/>* Part of this emergency assistance is devoted to &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; cases across self-employed and micro-sized firms.

To preserve bank lending and liquidity, the ECB will temporarily conduct additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and lower the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). On the supervisory front, the ECB has temporarily lowered bank capital requirements and introduced flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans. Furthermore, the ECB has expanded its asset purchase programme by an overall EUR 870 billion (7.3% of euro area GDP) until the end of 2020, while opening the door to freeing its self-imposed limits.

Movement of goods is not to be affected. With regard to internal border controls in the Schengen area, member states have endorsed the guidelines proposed by the Commission on border management, which call inter alia for proportionality and non-discrimination between own nationals and resident EU citizens.	3	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	* The EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII; proposed on 13 March, in force since 1 April) will accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April and in force since 24 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April). Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.<Br/><Br/>* At the request of Member States, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/><Br/>*   EUR 1 billion has been provided as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing (announced on 13 March, implemented on 6 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 9 April, EU finance ministers decided to establish Pandemic Crisis Support credit lines within the framework of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Access granted will be 2% of the respective country's GDP as of end-2019, as a benchmark (about &euro;240 billion in total). The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. The only requirement to access the credit line is that euro area Member States requesting support would commit to use this credit line to finance direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission adopted on 19 March a Temporary Framework, in place until end-2020, to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules.<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced on 16 March a plan (currently being deployed) to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.<Br/><Br/>* In addition to the above plan, EU finance ministers endorsed on 9 April an EIB proposal to create a EUR 25 billion guarantee fund, which will support up to EUR 200 billion of financing for companies (especially SMEs) throughout the EU. The scheme will be implemented by the EIB Group, in close partnership with national promotional banks and other financial intermediaries. By guaranteeing parts of loan portfolios, operations under the guarantee fund will free up capital for the financial intermediaries involved to make further financing available for SMEs and mid-caps.<Br/><Br/>* The Commission presented on 2 April a proposal for a new instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE). SURE support will take the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States, to help them cover the costs directly related to the creation or extension of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures for the self-employed, in the context of the current crisis. EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees voluntarily committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. An instrument along these lines was endorsed by EU finance ministers on 9 April.	Information not available	Information not available	* The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry.<Br/><Br/>* On 19 March, the Commission decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile was EUR 50 million, subsequently increased to EUR 80 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.<Br/><Br/>* On 2 April, the Commission presented a legislative proposal (in force since 15 April) to activate and extend the scope of the Emergency Support Instrument, with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget to directly purchase or procure emergency support on behalf of Member States, financially support and co-ordinate pressing needs such as the transportation of medical equipment and of patients in cross-border regions, and support the construction of mobile field hospitals.<Br/><Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		* The ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o 12 March: lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o 12 March: conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o 18 March, further detailed on 7 April: easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework. These measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, include expanding the use of credit claims as collateral, reducing collateral valuation haircuts and taking a number of other temporary steps, such as a waiver to accept Greek sovereign debt instruments as collateral.<Br/>o 22 April: adopting temporary measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades. More specifically, the ECB will grandfather the eligibility of marketable assets and the issuers of such assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 in the event of downgrades, as long as the ratings remain at or above BB.<Br/>o 30 April: reducing further the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) until June 2021, to 50 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/>o 30 April: conducting a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). These will consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o 12 March: adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o 18 March: furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o 18 March: expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. 	* Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities (12 March). In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March), and announced a temporary reduction in capital requirements for market risk (16 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 28 April, the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation (EU) 575/2013) to provide temporary capital relief to banks. These changes include inter alia extending by 2 years the current transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital, a later date of application of the leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important institutions, a more favourable treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the NPL prudential backstop (the minimum loss coverage requirement for non-performing loans), and advancing the date of application of capital reduction factors in respect of certain loans to SMEs or in support of infrastructure investments.

This measure relieves liquidity constraints.<Br/><Br/>- On 13 March, the Riksbank has decided to lend up to SEK 500 billion (about 10% of GDP) (about &euro;46 billion) to companies via the banks, to avoid robust companies being knocked out as a result of the spread of the coronavirus.

The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.  	--		Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation and paid out quickly. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. 	--		Information not available	--		On March 19, the Central Bank (SNB) maintained its expansionary monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate and the interest rate on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75%. Moreover, the SNB announced it would provide liquidity as part of the extended swap arrangements with other central banks, particularly in US dollars. To ensure the provision of sufficient liquidity to the banking system, the SNB decided to raise the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system. 	On March 25, the Confederation, the SNB and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authorities announced a package of measures together with the banks. In this context, the SNB is introducing the new SNB COVID-19 refinancing facility (CRF). This measure is aimed at strengthening the supply of credit to the Swiss economy by providing the banking system with additional liquidity. In these refinancing operations, the government-guaranteed bank loans serve as collateral. The CRF thus operates in conjunction with the federal government's guarantees for corporate loans. The setup is such that banks should be able to provide loans to small and medium enterprises within a day or two, starting March 26.On March 25, the SNB announced that it had recommended to the Confederation the deactivation of the anticyclical capital buffer. The deactivation should further enhance corporate credit supply by banks. 	Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	Information not available
