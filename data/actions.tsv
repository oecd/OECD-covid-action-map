ARG	08-Apr-2020	-33.166	-64.31	Argentina	The government has ordered complete confinement of the population from 20 March until 12 April. Police is controlling the streets and non-compliance with measures is prosecuted as criminal offence.	All borders are entirely closed from 27 March until 12 April.	All schools and universities closed as of 16 March.	All shops and public spaces are closed from March 20 until 12 April, only supermarkets, small groceries shops, hardware stores and pharmacies as well as certain parts of public administration remain open. As of 3 April, the following additional activities are excluded from the mandatory quarantine: distribution of construction materials, mining, forrestry, manufacturing of wood, furniture, leather as well as agricultural or construction machines, imports and exports of already produced items, nuclear fuel production, maintenance and desinfection services as well as a minimum service of banks and savings and credit cooperatives. As of 8 April, notary services are also excluded from confinement measures. As of 6 April, a specific certificate is necessary for all workers and other individuals allowed to leave their household during the confinement.	The construction of 8 new emergency hospitals has been announced. The government is cooperating with domestic equipment producers and laboratories to increase their supply and has started decentralised testing throughout the country as of 28 March. It has purchased 200,000 reagents for large-scale testing activities and the health system disposes of 8500 Intensive Care Units, which are supposed to be increased to 10,000. All workers in the health sector will receive a monthly bonus of 75 USD from April until July 2020. Prices for personal care, drugs and medical products have been fixed for 30 days. Exports of medical equipment necessary for the treatment of COVID infected patients require prior authorisation from the government. As of 1 April, imports of medical supplies and vaccines are exempted from import duties until the end of the emergency situation. Social security contributions for companies providing healthcare-related services are reduced by 95%.	Public investment will be boosted by around 0.5% of GDP, mainly in road infrastructure, housing and school construction as well as infrastructure for tourism. Public credit subsidies for private housing construction will be reinstated and extended, providing opportunities to refurbish homes during confinement, with a focus on domestically produced materials.	Households that live from informal activities, self-employment or domestic work and have suffered income losses will receive a one-off bonus of USD 150 in April. Conditional cash transfers to poor families are boosted by a one-off bonus of USD 50. Retirees and non-contributory pension beneficiaries with minimum pensions will obtain a USD 50 one-off bonus, while other benefits will be topped up to the new level of the regular minimum pension after including the bonus. Employers are not allowed to fire workers during a period of 60 days (as of 31 March), if the reason is related to the confinement measures or an unfair cause. Employers are required to pay part of the salaries of confined private sector workers, and negotiations between social partners will determine the respective amounts. People aged 60 and above, pregnant women and people in risk groups are dispensed from working and cannot face any negative consequences as a result. Unemployment insurance protection has been reinforced  for workers dismissed without a fair cause during the lockdown. Prices for food, personal care, drugs and medical products have been fixed for 30 days and public food programmes are expanded. All workers in the health sector will receive a monthly bonus of 75 USD from April until July. Workers in the security and public defense sector receive a one-off bonus of USD 75 in April. Installments of credits granted by the Social Security Agency corresponding to April and May have been cancelled. During the health emergency situation, access to electricity and gas will not be suspended for households unable to pay their bills. All rent contracts are automatically prolonged until 30 September, rents are fixed at their March levels and tenants cannot be forced to leave apartments due to non-payment of rents (as of 29 March). Until 30 April, banks are not allowed to close banking accounts. As of 1 April, the usage of all roads is free of charge until 12 April, including concession contract and PPP projects.	In sectors particularly affected by the lockdown such as entertainment, transport, restaurants and hotels, the government will pay part of the salaries and exempt employers from social security contributions. A specific committee has been created to establish objective criteria for accessing these benefits (6 April). Public banks will support private companies with working capital for up to 180 days. This measure seeks to target firms most affected by the lockdown, with a focus on small and medium size enterprises. Rates will be around half of current inflation, with an estimated fiscal cost of around 0.33% of GDP. Part of these credits will be directed to companies producing foodstuff, medicaments and hygienic articles as well as equipment necessary for teleworking. To protect banks, soft-credit lines will be guaranteed by the State through a Public Credit Guarantee Fund which has received additional resources from the government. During the health emergency situation, access to electricity and gas will not be suspended for SMEs unable to pay their bills. 	Monetary policy has already been loosened considerably with policy rates decreasing by 25 percentage points in the last 2 months and strong increases in the monetary base.	
AUS	09-Apr-2020	-24.578	133.582	Australia	From 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020, only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days. From 28 March, all travellers arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14 day self-isolation at designated facilities. Interstate travel is possible, but individual states have introduced a requirement to self isolate for 14 days after arrival. 	Only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. On 24 March, it was announced that Australians are not allowed to take a return trip overseas, unless in exceptional circumstances. Cruise ships from foreign ports have been banned.  <Br/>On 27 March 2020, the Western Australian government imposed restrictions on travel within the state. Western Australians will not be permitted to leave their regional boundary unless under exceptional circumstances (e.g. employment purposes, medical reasons, health and emergency services, people living in border communities, transport of essential goods, compassionate grounds). 	No national blanket closure of schools. Public schools in several sub-national jurisdictions have moved to online-only learning. Private and independent schools exercise discretion on closure and delivery methods.	The government (National Cabinet, made up of the Prime Minister, premiers and territory leaders) has now limited both indoor and outdoor gatherings to two persons only.Exceptions to this limit include: i) People of the same household going out together; ii) Funerals (a maximum of 10 people); iii) Wedding (a maximum of 5 people); iv) Family units.The government's strong guidance to all Australians is to stay home unless for: i) shopping for what you need (food and necessary supplies); ii) medical or health care needs, including compassionate requirements; iii) exercise in compliance with the public gathering requirements; iv) work and study if you can't work or learn remotely. However, each State Government has adopted rules that are unique to their situation. In all jurisdictions, playgrounds, skate parks and outside gyms in public places have been closed.	On 11 March, the Government committed an additional A$2.4 billion to support the health system to manage any further outbreak in Australia. The package provided support across primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the National Medical Stockpile, along with a national communication campaign. The package also provided funding to ensure Australia had sufficient personal protective equipment and medicines in addition to infection control training and programs for health and aged care workers.<Br/>On 15 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced that health services had moved into the 'Targeted Action' stage of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This included moving resources within hospitals to priority areas, establishing fever clinics which specialise in COVID-19, cancelling elective surgeries to free up capacity in public hospitals and adapting hospital resources (i.e. rooms and equipment) for use in priority areas, such as Intensive Care Units. <Br/>On 29 March, the Prime Minister announced an additional A$1.1 billion in funding for mental health services, domestic violence support, Medicare assistance for people at home (including through telehealth services) and emergency food relief.<Br/>On 31 March, the Government announced a partnership with private health providers for their infrastructure, essential equipment, supplies, workforce and additional resources to be made available to the public health system. In return, the government would ensure the viability of these enterprises. In essence, this agreement will integrate the private and public health systems in the event that capacity in the public system is strained. <Br/>	Total direct spending across Commonwealth and State Governments amounts to A$208.7bn (10&frac12;% of GDP). State Government stimulus packages include:<Br/><Br/>* The Victorian government announced a A$1.7bn (0.1% of GDP) stimulus that included a fund to provide employment for some dismissed workers, payroll tax refunds for businesses and supports for firms in the worst-affected sectors. <Br/><Br/>* The New South Wales government has announced two stimulus packages totalling around A$3bn (0.2% of GDP) package that included payroll tax relief for firms and new capital projects. <Br/><Br/>* The Queensland government have announced a A$4bn (0.2% of GDP) stimulus package including the establishment of a loan facility for impacted businesses, payroll tax relief and discount utility bills for households. <Br/><Br/>* The Western Australian government announced a A$607mn package (0.03% of GDP) that included a freeze on household fees and charges and payroll tax relief for firms. <Br/><Br/>* The Tasmanian government has announced approximately A$985mn (0.05% of GDP) in measures that includes payments to households, health spending, interest free loans to small businesses and payroll tax waivers for businesses in sectors most heavily impacted and targeted industry assistance.<Br/><Br/>* The South Australian government has announced A$1bn (0.05% of GDP) in measures. These include a fund to provide employment opportunities, payroll tax relief, land tax relief, a one-off boost of A$500 for households who are receiving welfare support and a waiver of liquor licence fees for 2020-21 for those hotels, restaurants, cafes and clubs forced to close. <Br/><Br/>* The Australian Capital Territory announced a A$137 million stimulus package targeting vulnerable households through cash payments and small business through the provision of credit and a fund for contractors to undertake simple works on government assets. <Br/><Br/>* The Northern Territory announced a A$115 million stimulus package including payroll tax exemption, grants to businesses and not-for-profit and community organisations and a home improvement scheme.<Br/>	On 30 March, the Commonwealth Government announced a planned wage subsidy to businesses (A$130bn or 6&frac12;% of GDP) to encourage them to keep workers in jobs. A &ldquo;JobKeeper Payment&rdquo; of A$1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee will be paid to the business under the condition that every eligible employee receives at least A$ 1,500 per fortnight from the business. The Jobkeeper Payment covers full-time and part-time employees, as well as employees stood down ahead of the commencement of the scheme, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months and the self employed. Eligible businesses are those with a turnover of less than A$1 billion that can demonstrate a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable month one year ago (firms with turnover of greater than A$1 billion must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in turnover). The programme commenced 30 March, with the first payments being received by eligible businesses in the first week of May as monthly arrears from the Australian Taxation Office.<Br/>There has been a temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight.  This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. The supplement will be paid for the next six months. <Br/>Social security and veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders will receive up to two separate cash payments of $750 (those who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive the second cash payment of A$750). <Br/>The government has announced some relaxation of the partner income test for employees applying for unemployment benefits and the Coronavirus Supplement of A$550 per fortnight. An individual can now receive these benefits provided that their partner earns less than A$79,762 per annum (the threshold was previously less than A$48k). <Br/>The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  <Br/>On April 2, a subsidy to childcare providers was announced, conditional on them staying open and not charging families for care. The Commonwealth Government will pay 50 per cent of the sector's fee revenue up to the existing hourly rate cap. The funding will apply from 6 April based on the number of children who were in care during the fortnight leading into 2 March, whether or not they are attending services.<Br/>Some labour market regulations have also been temporarily relaxed for the duration of the crisis. Across a large range of work types (103 of the 121 modern awards), employees will receive two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave. The covered employees will also be allowed to take double the duration of annual leave at half pay. There have also been changes to three specific awards that cover about 2 million workers, those related to restaurants, hospitality and the clerks award. These changes will allow an individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification perform another type of duty in another type of classification.<Br/>	New Commonwealth Government measures include support for business investment, including by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access to this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures. Measures have also been implemented to support business cash flows (including through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). <Br/>A range of measures have been taken to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). These have been complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits.<Br/>Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government will guarantee 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility will be A$40bn (2% of GDP). Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, businesses with up to A$10mn in total loan facilities will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.<Br/>On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants.<Br/>On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.<Br/>	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent); 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent; 3) the introduction of a A$90bn (4.5% of GDP) term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses; 4) Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/>On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	
AUT	10-Apr-2020	47.65	14.705	Austria	Besides a country-wide lockdown, authorities have enforced a strict quarantine in a number of municipalities across four Austrian regions. <Br/><Br/>Tyrol (external borders with DEI and ITA)<Br/><Br/>* Two popular ski regions (Paznauntal, St. Anton/Arlberg) have been under quarantine since March 13.<Br/><Br/>* The rest of Tyrol has been quarantined since March 19.<Br/><Br/>* The region-wide quarantine was lifted on April 7, though Paznauntal, St. Anton and S&ouml;lden remain quarantined at least until Aril 13. <Br/><Br/>Salzburg region (external borders with DEU and ITA) <Br/><Br/>* Several municipalities (Gasteinertal, Gro&szlig;arltal, Flachau) have been quarantined since March 19.<Br/><Br/>* The quarantine was extended to Zell am See, Saalbach-Hinterglemm and Altenmarkt im Pongau on March 31.<Br/><Br/>* On April 13, authorities will decide whether these municipalities will remain under quarantine.<Br/><Br/>Vorarlberg (external borders with CHE, DEU and LIE)<Br/><Br/>* The municipalities Lech-Z&uuml;rs, Warth, Schr&ouml;cken, Stuben, Nenzing-Dorf and Nenzing-Beschling were quarantined from March 19 to April 3.<Br/><Br/>Carinthia (external borders with ITA and SVN)<Br/><Br/>* Heiligenblut was under quarantine from March 19 to March 29.	* The government has restricted access on Austria's external borders. Freight transport, transits and returning Austrians are exempted.<Br/><Br/>* Official air and external train traffic is suspended.	Since March 16, all schools are closed at least until mid-May.  	* Austrian authorities have enforced a country-wide lockdown since March 16. <Br/><Br/>* As of March 10, big indoor and outdoor events have been cancelled and the government closed the external border with Italy. <Br/><Br/>* On March 13, authorities announced the closure of schools from March 16 on and closed all shops besides supermarkets, pharmacies and a couple of other essential shops (a full list of businesses still allowed to open is found here). Museums, monuments, restaurants and bars are also closed. <Br/><Br/>* All events with more than five people are prohibited. In addition, municipal council elections in Styria and Vorarlberg (initially scheduled for March 22) have been postponed until further notice.<Br/><Br/>* From April 3 on, authorities allow to order and pick up take-a-way food from restaurants, though guests are still prohibited from eating on the premises. <Br/><Br/>* On April 6, authorities have announced a gradual lift of the lockdown.<Br/>o From April 14 on, small shops (< 400m2), small handicraft businesses, hardware stores and garden centers are allowed to open for business.<Br/>o All other shops, including hairdressers, may open from May 1 onwards.<Br/>o Restaurants, bars and hotels remain closed, at least until the end of April.<Br/>o Public events remain prohibited at least until end of June.<Br/>o Schools and universities remain closed until mid-May.	Due to the closed borders especially with Hungary and the Slovak Republic, maintaining 24h long-term care of the elderly is a major problem. Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border and a further 30% from the Slovak Republic. Slovaks, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. Though the Austrian government is in negotiations with its neighbours no solution has been reached so far. <Br/><Br/>For the moment, the government has introduced two immediate measures for the 460.000 persons in need of care. Firstly, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional Civilian Servants can be mobilized this way. Secondly, federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for mobile and stationary care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments. Lower Austria flied in 231 care-takes directly from Bulgaria and Romania. <Br/><Br/>From April 1 on, the government has introduced further measures to contain the propagation of the virus. Wearing masks is now mandatory in open spaces, including supermarkets. Vulnerable people have to work from home. <Br/><Br/>The government has started testing representative samples of Austrians for infection with Covid-19. A first test with 2,197 Austrians suggested a rather low rate of infection (around 1% of total population). Further testing with larger samples are planned in the near future.<Br/>	* A budget envelope of currently EUR 38 billion (10% of GDP including credit guarantees and tax deferrals) is gradually implemented and operationalized. Austrian authorities have signaled to mobilize additional help if needed. <Br/><Br/>* The budget envelope consists of the following items, which are already implemented or soon to be implemented:<Br/>o Emergency funds for hard-hit industries which provides direct liquidity provisions and subsidies for running costs (EUR 15 billion).<Br/>o Credit guarantees (up to EUR 9 billion).<Br/>o Tax deferrals (up to EUR 10 billion) for personal income and corporate income taxes. Taxes can be deferred until end of September. Deferrals of social security contributions are possible for the months February to April.<Br/>o A compartment of EUR 4 billion including funds for short-time working (EUR 1 billion), as well as EUR 1 billion for hardship cases across freelancers, family enterprises and sole proprietorships and funds to finance increased costs of caretaking.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* Further EUR 36 million are disbursed through an emergency-call for research by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) to incentivize eligible research on Covid-19 by Austrian firms. <Br/><Br/>* Moreover, the government has spent around EUR 13 million on medical supplies.<Br/>	* All workers (private and public sector) can be requested to use all remaining leave days from last year and to deplete any over-time hours.  <Br/><Br/>* Short-time working (EUR 1 billion): The Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) takes over the salary of all workers (except public service) including apprentices of min. 10% up to 90% of the working time according to collective bargaining agreements up to a certain threshold (100% for apprentices). This threshold depends on gross salary and is 90% for salaries below EUR 1,700, 85% for salaries below EUR 2,685 and 80% for salaries below EUR 5,370; apprentices will be compensated in full. Any application to the short-time working scheme will be handled within 48h. The employer's share of social security contributions is covered as well.<Br/><Br/>* The Ministry of Finance will take over one third of labour costs for workers who have to take care of children up to an age of 14 due to closed schools or kindergartens.<Br/><Br/>* Short-time working is limited to three months with the possibility to reapply for another three months.                    <Br/>* Austrians are allowed to defer payments for rent and interest payments on bank loans.<Br/>	Swift support measures (up to EUR 4 billion)<Br/><Br/>* Self-employed and micro-sized enterprises (< 10 employees) are supported by EUR 2 billion.<Br/><Br/>* A single entity can tap up to EUR 6,000 within three months.<Br/><Br/>Credit guarantees (of up to EUR 9 billion)<Br/><Br/>* Around EUR 2 billion is provided through an export credit scheme and intends to cover up to 15 % of operating costs of exporting companies. <Br/><Br/>* General liquidity provisions are granted by the Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (aws), a federal development and financing bank. <Br/><Br/>* The aws supports firms of all sizes in all industries except the tourism sector, which is covered by the public Tourism bank. The funds for general liquidity provisions by the public Tourism bank will be stepped up to EUR 1 billion (from EUR 100 million).<Br/><Br/>* Self-employed can tap the credit guarantees as well. <Br/><Br/>* The aws covers only credits necessary to preserve liquidity but does not cover debt restructurings. <Br/><Br/>* The minister of Finance has been entitled to increase the guarantee envelope with a sunset clause of three months. <Br/><Br/>Emergency assistance (EUR 15 billion) <Br/><Br/>* The emergency assistance intends to support industries hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and will provide direct liquidity provisions and subsidies for operating costs. <Br/><Br/>* Part of this emergency assistance is devoted to &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; cases across self-employed and micro-sized firms. Under certain conditions, they can get subsidies of up to EUR 6,000 for three months per entity. These subsidies have not to be paid back.<Br/><Br/>* More details are expected to be disclosed in the week after Easter.	The ECB has committed to &ldquo;do everything necessary within its mandate&rdquo; to support the economy through this shock. To preserve bank lending and liquidity, the ECB will temporarily conduct additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and lower the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). On the supervisory front, the ECB has temporarily lowered bank capital requirements and introduced flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans. Furthermore, the ECB has expanded its asset purchase programme by an overall EUR 870 billion (7.3% of euro area GDP) until the end of 2020, while opening the door to freeing its self-imposed limits. More details and additional measures are presented in the EU note.	
BEL	30-Mar-2020	50.773	4.809	Belgium	Containment measures were reinforced as of March 18, which will remain in place until April 19. Citizens are required to stay at home, except for work and daily necessities (food shops, post office, bank, pharmacy, hospitals, etc.). All public gatherings are prohibited.

Non-essential shops and retail outlets are closed from 18 March. Firms are obliged to organise telework and, if this is not possible for certain employees, social distancing will be strictly respected. If firms cannot meet these obligations, they must be closed temporarily. These measures will apply until April 19. 	The federal government provides additional resources to grant a cash advance to hospitals, which will be regulated taking account of exceptional costs and loss of revenues (around EUR 1 billion, 0.2% of GDP).	* All payment deadlines for personal income tax, corporate income tax, VAT and withholding tax are automatically extended by two months. <Br/><Br/>* Additional measures to delay payments of tax arrears. In certain cases, no late-payment interest will be due and penalties for not paying taxes will be waived.

BRA	08-Apr-2020	-11.694	-48.978	Brazil	No nationwide lockdown. 23 of Brazil's 27 federative units (states) have imposed stronger confinement measures. Authorizations for entry into indigenous lands are suspended, with the exception of those related to essential services.	All land borders are closed and entry by air from certain countries in Europe and Asia, plus Australia, is restricted to Brazilian nationals and residents.  Measures to restrict the movement of people and businesses operations are in place in big cities (Rio de Janeiro, S&atilde;o Paulo and Bras&iacute;lia, among others). Some Brazilian states are considering restricting movements across state borders.	Schools are not closed nationwide, but several states and municipalities have closed educational institutions. For example, in S&atilde;o Paulo, schools have been closed since 23/3.	Local authorities have cancelled many large events.	An additional 0.4% of GDP have been assigned to the public healthcare system. Taxes and import duties on goods used by hospitals have been zeroed and import procedures eased. Hiring of 2,000 new beds in ICUs announced. The Health Ministry opened 5,800 vacancies for doctors. Resident doctors will receive a 20% bonus, worth USD 130. <Br/>Telemedicine services have been allowed. Physicians can make consultations online and issue electronically signed medical reports or prescriptions.Rapid test kits: the Federal government and states are preparing to distribute 10 million units.<Br/>	A state of emergency declaration by Congress exempts the government from meeting 2020 fiscal target. Brazil's government passed a large emergency package, but this also includes anticipated disbursements of benefits and postponed tax liabilities. In the areas of social protection and health, however, significant additional spending measures are being taken.	Informal workers and the unemployed will receive, over 3 months, a temporary new benefit of USD 120 per month (USD 240 for single mothers) provided that they earn less than half a minimum wage and are not covered by other social benefits except Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia (27/3). The estimated fiscal cost is 1.3% of GDP. Additional spending of 0.04% of GDP on the conditional cash transfer programme Bolsa Familia aims at a rapid reduction of waiting lines for programme enrolment and could imply up to 1 million of additional beneficiaries. Formal workers and their employers can benefit from a new short-time work scheme with public income support from unemployment insurance. In return, employers guarantee employment for twice the period covered by the benefit. Benefit levels are 80% of earnings for those earning 1 minimum wage and capped at 1.8 minimum wages. All benefits are pro-rated for the reduction of working hours of the worker, which can be 25%, 50%, 70% or 100% in the case of suspension. The estimated fiscal cost is around 0.7% of GDP. Withdrawals from individual unemployment insurance accounts will become possible as of mid-June. School meals may be distributed directly to families of public school students while schools are closed.	For SMEs, an emergency credit line has been opened to cover 2 months of wages for employees earning up to 2 minimum wages, under the condition that the employee is not dismissed. This is a loan over 36 months, with a grace period of 6 months, and a nominal interest rate below current inflation. Payments are directly disbursed into workers' accounts, but firms are liable for the debt. 85% of the credit risk is borne by the federal government. Tax liabilities and other charges on firms are being postponed, with a particular focus on SMEs. The government will pay the first 15 days of sick leave for infected workers. <Br/>    The national development bank BNDES has announced new credit lines to companies with a loan volume of 0.6% of GDP. 	The policy rate Selic was cut by 50 bps on 18/3 to 3.75%. On 23/3 the Central Bank announced a liquidity injection worth 17% of GDP, to be implemented through lower reserve and capital requirements and special liquidity lines for banks. The Central Bank undertook repo operations to support the value of the currency. A USD 60 billion swap line with the US Federal Reserve will help Brazil manage pressures on its currency.

This includes the deadline for submission of the annual income tax return and for payment of the tax assessed, which have been extended until end-June for firms/sole traders involved in commerce and for farmers who pay taxes under this regime. 	Liquidity support to firms announced. An increase of BGN 700 million is provided to the BDB's capital, which includes BDB portfolio guarantees in the amount of BGN 500 million (EUR 255 million), in order to provide them to commercial banks to allow them to give more flexible conditions for business loans and BGN 200 million (EUR 102 million) for guaranteeing non-interest consumer loans up to BGN 1500 (EUR 765) for employees who have gone on unpaid leave. With the funds given to BDBs, the business and citizens will be able to acquire credits at the amount up to BGN 2.5 billion (EUR 1.27 billion).   	There is a currency board in place since July 1997 that fixes the national currency to the euro. The Bulgarian National Bank has stated that it is taking measures to ensure the smooth functioning of the currency board and stands ready to put additional actions in place if necessary. The Bulgarian National Bank has introduced measures of BGN 9.3 billion (Eur 4.7 billion) to strengthen the resilience of the banking system and enhance its ability to decrease the negative impacts of the pandemic on individuals and firms. These comprise full capitalisation of the profits in the banking system in the amount of BGN 1.6 billion (Eur 0.8 billion), cancellation of the increase in the countercyclical capital buffer planned for 2020 and 2021, and an increase in banking system liquidity. <Br/><Br/>

Otherwise, the banking system is judged stable and well capitalised, able to withstand adverse developments.                                                                                                                                                          <Br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <Br/>- On 16 March 2020, the Czech National Bank cut the main policy rate by 50 basis points, to 1.75%.<Br/><Br/>- The Board declared that it was ready to cut interest rates further should this be warranted by economic developments. It announced that it stood ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent excessive volatility of the koruna (in line with the managed float).<Br/><Br/>- While the Board does not detect a shortage of liquidity in the banking sector, it will from now on conduct its liquidity-providing repo operations three times a week instead of once a week, with no spread over the policy rate (previously 10bps).                                                                                                                                              <Br/><Br/>- The Board also revised its earlier decision to increase the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 2% with effect from 1 July 2020.

On 1 April, the CNB relaxed credit ratio limits for new mortgages, to avoid excessively tight credit standards amid the weakening economy. The limit on the LTV (the size of the loan relative to the value of the property) ratio was increased to 90% (from 80%, but this change does not apply to "investment" mortgages). The limit on the DSTI ratio (total debt service relative to net monthly income) was raised to 50% (from 45%). The current limit on the DTI ratio (debt relative to net income) was cancelled.                                                                                                                                                       An amendment to the Act on the Czech National Bank (CNB) was passed has been proposed, that temporarily allows the CNB to trade instruments with maturities of more than one year. In addition, the CNB can from now on trade also with non-bank financial institutions, such as insurance and pension companies or with other institutional investors. Furthermore, on April 1 the government approved a proposal to declare a moratorium on the payment of loans and mortgages. Debtors <Br/>- individuals as well as companies <Br/>- will be able to interrupt their payments for a period of three or six months.

Moreover, the government has committed to provide the needed resources to the health sector (amount not quantified).<Br/><Br/>Investments by municipalities are being frontloaded to support economic activity and budget ceilings are temporarily suspended (EUR 0.3 billion).	Support to self-employed: Self-employed and freelancers experiencing a drop in turnover of more than 30% can get cash support amounting to 75% of the loss (max EUR 3 100 per month).

EU	10-Apr-2020	55	4.5	European Union	Information not available	On March 17, EU member states agreed to restrict non-essential travel to the European Union for an initial period of 30 days, with exceptions mainly for EU and British citizens, long-time residents, cross-border commuters, health care workers and workers delivering goods. Movement of goods is not to be affected. With regard to internal border controls in the Schengen area, member states have endorsed the guidelines proposed by the Commission on border management, which call inter alia for proportionality and non-discrimination between own nationals and resident EU citizens.	Information not available	Information not available	* The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry.<Br/><Br/>* On 19 March, the Commission decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile is EUR 50 million, which the Commission has proposed to increase to EUR 80 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.<Br/><Br/>* On 2 April, the Commission presented legislative proposals for an Emergency Support Instrument for the healthcare sector, with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget to directly purchase or procure emergency support on behalf of Member States, financially support and co-ordinate pressing needs such as the transportation of medical equipment and of patients in cross-border regions, and support the construction of mobile field hospitals.	* The EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII; proposed on 13 March, in force since 1 April) will accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April). Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.<Br/><Br/>* At the request of Member States, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/><Br/>*   EUR 1 billion has been provided as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing (announced on 13 March, implemented on 6 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 9 April, EU finance ministers decided to establish Pandemic Crisis Support credit lines within the framework of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Access granted will be 2% of the respective country's GDP as of end-2019, as a benchmark (about &euro;240 billion in total). The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. The only requirement to access the credit line is that euro area Member States requesting support would commit to use this credit line to finance direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis.	Information not available	* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission adopted on 19 March a Temporary Framework, in place until end-2020, to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules.<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced on 16 March a plan (currently being deployed) to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.<Br/><Br/>* In addition to the above plan, EU finance ministers endorsed on 9 April an EIB proposal to create a EUR 25 billion guarantee fund, which will support up to EUR 200 billion of financing for companies (especially SMEs) throughout the EU. The scheme will be implemented by the EIB Group, in close partnership with national promotional banks and other financial intermediaries. <Br/><Br/>* The Commission presented on 2 April a proposal for a new instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE). SURE support will take the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States, to help them cover the costs directly related to the creation or extension of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures for the self-employed, in the context of the current crisis. EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees voluntarily committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. An instrument along these lines was endorsed by EU finance ministers on 9 April.	* The ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o 12 March: lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o 12 March: conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o 18 March: easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework.<Br/>o Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities (12 March). In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March).<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o 12 March: adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o 18 March: furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o 18 March: expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. <Br/>

To preserve bank lending and liquidity, the ECB will temporarily conduct additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and lower the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). On the supervisory front, the ECB has temporarily lowered bank capital requirements and introduced flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans. Furthermore, the ECB has expanded its asset purchase programme by an overall EUR 870 billion (7.3% of euro area GDP) until the end of 2020. This mainly consists of the EUR 750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, to which some of the ECB self-imposed limits for asset purchases will not apply.

IOSROs will be carried out through a fixed-rate auction with a pro-rata allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the repurchase (repo) rate. <Br/>2. Weekly Main Refinancing Operations: The additional money market liquidity provided to clearing banks via the IOSROs will result in the current money market shortage (MMS) declining below the current target level of R56 billion. The size of the Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) will be kept at R56 billion and increased if necessary.<Br/>3. Standing Facilities:  The Standing Facilities (SF) borrowing rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB absorbs liquidity <Br/>- will be adjusted to the repo rate less 200 basis points, from the current repo rate less 100 basis points. The SARB deems this change necessary in order to encourage the flow of money market liquidity. The SF lending rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB provides liquidity to the commercial banks <Br/>- will be adjusted lower to the repo rate, from the prevailing rate of the repo rate plus 100 basis points. This will support banks to facilitate their flow of money market liquidity without being penalised. <Br/>

SWE	03-Apr-2020	65.903	18.572	Sweden	Since early March, everyone with symptoms of respiratory infection, even mild ones, was urged to avoid social contacts, both at work and in private, and throughout the country. On 16 March, the health authority (Folkh&auml;lsomyndigheten) recommended as much as possible isolating people over 70 and working from home. 	On 14 March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised against non-essential travel to all countries. <Br/>On 17 March, in response to the European Council's and the European Commission's call for travel restrictions, the government decided  to temporarily stop non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside the EEA and Switzerland, so as to mitigate the effects of the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and reduce the spread of the disease. The decision takes effect on 19 March and will initially apply for 30 days.	Many higher secondary schools (children aged over 16) and all universities have switched to distance learning as of 18 March. Schools for younger children are still open at this stage.	- Relatives should avoid "unnecessary visits" to hospitals and from 1 April, a ban on visiting elderly care institutions is imposed.<Br/><Br/>- Events with more than 50 persons are banned since 27 March. <Br/>	- The central government will compensate municipalities and regions for extraordinary measures and extra costs in health and medical care associated with the COVID-19 virus. On 2 April, the amount was raised to SEK 3bn from SEK 2bn. <Br/><Br/>- On 2 April, the government announced that grants to municipalities and regions will increase by SEK 20bn in 2020, up from SEK 5bn previously planned, of which SEK 12.5bn will be permanent. <Br/><Br/>- Sickness benefit to be paid for the first day of sickness.	The government has presented three comprehensive packages amounting to SEK 661.8 billion (about EUR 62.1 billion, nearly 13% of GDP), including liquidity provisions and credit guarantees if these are used by firms to the maximum.	- Postponement by 12 month of three month of preliminary income tax payments on salaries due between January and September 2020 (with interest charge)<Br/><Br/>- Sickness benefit qualifying day is temporarily discontinued and the government will assume the entire cost of all sick pay during April and May.<Br/><Br/>- Self-employed persons will be entitled to receive standardised sick pay for 14 days.<Br/><Br/>- On 30 March, the government announced a new crisis package for jobs and transition<Br/>o Temporary reinforcement of unemployment insurance: eligibility conditions (length of employment and membership of a fund) will be temporarily relaxed; both the highest and the lowest amounts paid out by an unemployment insurance fund will be raised temporarily; the six initial qualifying days will be removed; the unemployment insurance funds will receive funding for administration.<Br/>o More active labour market policy: increased funding for the public employment service and labour market policy programmes; the period during which a person may have a subsidised job (extra job, new start job or introductory job) will be extended by an additional year for those who already have such jobs; the maximum time for support for starting a business will be extended from six to twelve months; municipalities will receive grants for more summer jobs for young people and funding for green jobs.<Br/>o More places and more distance learning at higher education institutions to benefit unemployed and people who are given notice of the termination of their contract.<Br/>o More opportunities for vocational education and training throughout the country. <Br/>o Removal of the income ceiling for student aid: the income ceiling for all those receiving student aid will be temporarily removed so that health and medical care students can help out in the health care sector without their student aid being reduced.	- On 16 March, the short-term layoffs scheme was introduced. Employees receive more than 90 per cent of their wages, but employers' wage costs can be halved, thanks to the government subsidy. The subsidy level is significantly higher than in the previous short-time work scheme (estimated cost: SEK 20 billion).<Br/><Br/>- Liquidity reinforcement via tax accounts: companies can defer three months payment of employer social security contributions, preliminary tax on salaries and value added tax that are reported monthly or quarterly for up to 12 months, with interest. The new regulations take effect on 30 April, but can be retroactively applied from 1 January 2020. If companies use this opportunity to the same extent as in 2009, this would amount to SEK 27 billion. If all companies would use it to the maximum, this would amount to SEK 315 billion. To support SMEs, it will also be allowed to defer the value-added tax reported annually. Hence, companies can defer the payment of last year's VAT that is due shortly. If this is used to the maximum, it can amount to SEK 7 billion. In addition, SMEs can claim back the preliminary tax paid in 2019 and either pay it later or set it off against future losses (the maximum liquidity reinforcement could amount to SEK 13 billion). <Br/><Br/>- The Swedish Parliament has allowed the Government to issue credit guarantees of up to SEK 5 billion in 2020 for loans to airlines that on 1 January this year had a Swedish permit to operate commercial aviation and who have their main operations or headquarters in Sweden. <Br/><Br/>- On 20 March, the government announced a new support package for small businesses: <Br/>o Almi, a state agency which offers loans to companies with growth potential and assists in their business development, will get a new capital grant of SEK 3 billion (about EUR 270 million, 0.06% of GDP) to allow it to lend more to SMEs.<Br/>o The Swedish Export Credit Agency's loan limit is extended to SEK 200 billion (about EUR 18 billion, 3.8% of GDP) from SEK 125 billion.<Br/>o The ceiling for credit guarantees from the agency which insures export companies and banks against the risk of non-payment in export transactions (EKN) is increased to SEK 500 billion (about EUR 45bn, 9.6% of GDP) from SEK 450 billion, the same amount as during the 2008 financial crisis, and the coverage is extended to encompass sea shipping. <Br/><Br/>- On 20 March, the government announced support amounting to SEK 500 million (EUR 45 million ; 0.01% of GDP) for cultural activities that lose revenue as a result of the restriction on public events and the same amount for sports. <Br/><Br/>- On 25 March, the government announced another crisis package for small enterprises: <Br/>o Government guarantee on 70% of new bank loans to companies experiencing financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 virus but otherwise robust, up to SEK 75 million (with possible exceptions).<Br/>o Temporary reduction of employers' social security contributions to the old age pension contribution only for the period 1 March to 30 June 2020, up to 30 employees and on the portion of the employee's wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month. This entails tax relief of up to SEK 5 300 per employee per month. An equivalent relief applies to sole proprietors (estimated cost: SEK 33 billion).<Br/>o Temporary discount for rental costs in vulnerable sectors, such as durable consumer goods, hotels, restaurants and certain other activities, with the government covering 50% of the rental reduction up to 50% of the fixed rent (estimated cost: SEK 5 billion).<Br/>o Measures targeting small enterprises: 100% of the taxable profits of sole proprietors and partners in Swedish partnerships for 2019, up to SEK 1 mn, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. VAT reported by sole proprietors annually from 27 December 2019 to 17 January 2021 will be eligible to deferral, with interest. These measures will provide a maximum liquidity reinforcement of more than SEK 20 billion.	- On 13 March, the Riksbank has decided to lend up to SEK 500 billion (about 10% of GDP) (about &euro;46 billion) to companies via the banks, to avoid robust companies being knocked out as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. Banks will be allowed to borrow an unlimited amount at 3-month's maturity on a weekly basis against collateral at an interest rate of 20 bp above the repo rate. Flexibility will be increased on collateral requirements for banks when they borrow money from the Riksbank. <Br/><Br/>- On 13 March, Finansinspektionen (FSA) lowered its countercyclical capital buffer from 2.5% percentage points to 0%. This amounts to SEK 45 bn and should create a capacity of around SEK 900 billion (about 18% of GDP) for new lending. The FSA also announced that it will postpone all new investigations and on sight supervisory activities, in order to free up resources at the banks. <Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, FSA announced that it considers the loss of income associated with COVID-19 to qualify as a special reason that allows the bank and borrower to reach an agreement to reduce or suspend loan amortisation payments for a limited period of time.  FSA also clarified that it will temporarily allow banks to fall below the liquidity coverage ratio requirements for individual currencies and total currencies. This measure relieves liquidity constraints.<Br/><Br/>- On 16 March, the Riksbank decided to increase purchases of securities by up to SEK 300 billion in 2020. Given relative scarcity of government bonds, purchases can include municipal and mortgage bonds (in the Nordics, there is a deep and liquid market for the latter) as well as non-financial corporate bonds and commercial papers. <Br/><Br/>- On 19 March, the Riksbank and the US Federal Reserve agreed on a swap facility of 60 billion USD. The agreement will be in place for at least six months.<Br/><Br/>- On 24 March, the FSA stressed that it expects credit institutions to stop this year's dividend payments and use the earnings to further strengthen their capital.

Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation and paid out quickly. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. Businesses should have the possibility to extend payment deadlines without having to pay default interest. For this reason, the interest rate for VAT, customs duties, special excise taxes and incentive taxes will be reduced to 0.0 percent in the period from 21 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. No interest  will be charged during this period.   Companies affected by the crisis may be granted a temporary, interest-free deferral of payment of social security contributions. Companies also have the option of having the amount of the regular contributions adjusted if the sum of their wages has fallen significantly. The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.  Further help is available for companies of the sport and event industry as well as in tourism.     	On March 19, the Central Bank (SNB) maintained its expansionary monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate and the interest rate on sight deposits at the SNB at -0.75%. Moreover, the SNB announced it would provide liquidity as part of the extended swap arrangements with other central banks, particularly in US dollars. To ensure the provision of sufficient liquidity to the banking system, the SNB decided to raise the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system. On March 25, the Confederation, the SNB and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authorities announced a package of measures together with the banks. In this context, the SNB is introducing the new SNB COVID-19 refinancing facility (CRF). This measure is aimed at strengthening the supply of credit to the Swiss economy by providing the banking system with additional liquidity. In these refinancing operations, the government-guaranteed bank loans serve as collateral. The CRF thus operates in conjunction with the federal government's guarantees for corporate loans. The setup is such that banks should be able to provide loans to small and medium enterprises within a day or two, starting March 26.On March 25, the SNB announced that it had recommended to the Confederation the deactivation of the anticyclical capital buffer. The deactivation should further enhance corporate credit supply by banks.
