AUT	24-Mar-2020	47.65	14.705	Austria	Two popular ski regions (Paznauntal, St.Anton/Arlberg) in Tyrol have been under quarantine since March 13, the Gasteinertal and Grossarltal (both in the Salzburg region) and the rest of Tyrol since March 18.  	The government has restricted access on Austria's external borders for all neighbouring countries besides the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Transit is still possible. Official air traffic and external train traffic is suspended.	Latest since March 16, all schools and universities are closed	Austrian authorities have enforced a country-wide curfew since 15 March. As of 10 March, Austrian universities are closed, big indoor and outdoor events have been cancelled and the government closed the external border with Italy. On 13 March, authorities announced the closure of schools from 16 March on and closed all shops besides supermarkets, pharmacies and a couple of other essential shops (a full list of businesses still allowed to open is found here). Museums, monuments, restaurants and bars are also closed. All events with more than five people are prohibited. In addition, municipal council elections in Styria and Vorarlberg (initially scheduled for 22/03) have been postponed until further notice.	Due to the closed borders with Hungary,  maintaining 24h long-term care of the elderly is a major problem. Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border. Slovakians, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. Hungary has arrested Romanian care-takers who intended to travel to their workplace in Austria on their border. Though the Austrian government is in negotiations with its neighbours no solution has been reached so far. For the moment, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. This pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, who are also needed in other areas. A number of hotlines have been set up to provide Austrian with up-to-date and free info on the corona virus. In case of  suspected case of COVID19, an ambulance is called automatically. The Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection set up a taskforce to provide scientific advice from a medial point of view. 	Chancellor Kurz has announced a comprehensive support package on 18 March amounting to up to EUR 38 Billion (around 10% of GDP). Besides credit guarantees and short-time working it also encompasses tax deferrals of up to EUR 10 billion. A further EUR 50 million has been put aside for emergency assistance on hardship case across SMEs and EUR 100 million have been reserved for emergency help of family-owned enterprises and self-employed. More details on these two additional measures will be disclosed in the following days. More funds will be put aside to support the production of gloves, masks and several medicines in Austria. Further EUR 14 Million are put aside for short-term funding of COVID19 research and support to products related to COVID19 on a risk-capital base.	Short-time working (EUR 4 billion, 1% of GDP): The Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) takes over the salary of all workers (except public service) including apprentices of min. 10% up to 90% of the working time according to collective bargaining agreements up to a certain threshold. This threshold depends on gross salary and is 90% for salaries below EUR 1,700, 85% for salaries below EUR 2,685 and 80% for salaries below EUR 5,370. Any application to the short-time working scheme will be handled within 48h. The Ministry of Finance will take over one third of labours costs for workers who have to take care children now.	Credit guarantees (EUR 9 billion, 2.3% of GDP): The Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (aws), a federal development and financing bank, supports firms of all sizes in all industries except the tourism sector, which is covered by the public Tourism bank. Those who are self-employed can tap the credit guarantees as well. The aws covers only credits necessary to preserve liquidity, but does not  cover debt restructurings. Loans up to a limit of 80%, with a maximal amount of EUR 2.5million per SME, are guaranteed by the government through aws with a maturity of up to 5 years. No collateral or further equity is needed. Emergency assistance (EUR 15 billion, 3.8% of GDP) to support industries hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. No further details have been disclosed so far.	n/a

It announced that it stood ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent excessive volatility of the koruna (in line with the managed float).<Br/>- While the Board does not detect a shortage of liquidity in the banking sector, it will from now on conduct its liquidity-providing repo operations three times a week instead of once a week, with no spread over the policy rate (previously 10bps). <Br/>- The Board also revised its earlier decision to increase the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 2% with effect from 1 July 2020. This step will now not happen, and banks will continue to maintain the current buffer at 1.75%. The Board will closely observe the situation, and stands ready to reduce the buffer to 0%, if deemed necessary

EU	24-Mar-2020	55	4.5	European Union		On March 17, EU member states agreed to restrict non-essential travel to the European Union for an initial period of 30 days, with exceptions mainly for EU and British citizens, long-time residents, cross-border commuters, health care workers and workers delivering goods. Movement of goods is not to be affected. With regard to internal border controls in the Schengen area, member states have endorsed the guidelines proposed by the Commission on border management, which call inter alia for proportionality and non-discrimination between own nationals and resident EU citizens.			The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry. Additionally, on 19 March, the Commission has decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile is EUR 50 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.	* The Commission proposed a EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole. <Br/>* Other proposals by the Commission: <Br/>o   Extending the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund to cover major public health emergencies and to increase advance payments from this Fund (up to EUR 800 million available in 2020)<Br/>o   Using the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/>o   Providing EUR 1 billion from the EU budget as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing. <Br/>		* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission has adopted a Temporary Framework, in place until end-2020, to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules.<Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group has proposed a plan to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.	* In March the ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o Lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o Conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o Easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework.<Br/>o Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities. In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies.<Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o Adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o Furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP.<Br/>o Expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. <Br/>

GBR	20-Mar-2020	52.289	-1.259	United Kingdom	14-day isolation for households with symptoms		In place from Monday 23 March	? Cafes, pubs, restaurants, cinemas and gyms are closed from Monday 23 March	- Emergency funding of GBP 5 billion for the NSH<Br/>- Raise health workforce supply by recalling retired doctors and delaying non-urgent and elective care (although not a successful measure)<Br/>- The NHS is ordered to send medically fit patients home and delayed non-urgent and elective care to raise hospitals' capacity to cope with the COVID-19 outbreak. This freed up around 30,000 of the current 100,000 overnight acute beds across England.	The UK government announced a GBP 39 billion fiscal package (1.8% of GDP) to counter the impacts of the coronavirus. This comes on top of the GBP 18 billion additional public spending for infrastructure and housing (0.8% of GDP) announced during the presentation of the budget for 2020. It represents the largest sustained fiscal loosening since 1992. <Br/>The emergency spending of GBP 39 billion (or 1.8% of GDP) includes GBP 5 billion emergency funding for the NHS, GBP 28 billion business support and GBP 6 billion welfare support. In addition, GBP 30 billion (or 1.4% of GDP) of VAT revenues for the third quarter of 2020 are deferred until 2021. As for off balance sheet measures, GBP 330 billion are earmarked for a state loan guarantee scheme for struggling businesses.	Under the corona virus job retention scheme, all employers are eligible to apply for a grant to cover 80% of retained workers' salaries of up to GBP 2,500 a month. In a move to give self-employed access to universal credit, the government also suspended the minimum income floor of universal credit and increased the universal credit allowance by GBP 1,000 for the next twelve months. The government also introduced statutory sick pay for self-quarantined people.	The government will refund the cost of statutory sick leave up to 2 weeks for small businesses with less than 250 employees at a cost of GBP 2 billion. Around 700,000 small businesses will be eligible for an immediate GBP 3,000 cash grant at a cost of GBP 2 billion for the budget. In addition, UK chancellor Rushi Sunak unveiled a GBP 330 billion state loan guarantee scheme for struggling businesses on 17 March. Treasury will cover 1 billion, while the rest will be provided by the BoE financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Under this scheme, small business can request loans of up to GBP 25,000 for twelve months. In addition, VAT bills between now and the end of June are deferred until the end of the financial year. This represents GBP 30 bn or 1.4% of GDP. There will be also a freeze of business rates on property for heavily hit sectors in 2020, including retail, hospitality and entertainment.	- Policy rates: On 19 March 2020, the Bank of England (BoE) cut interest rates by 0.15 percentage point to an all-time low of 0.1%. This step came only a week after the first emergency Bank rate cut of 50 basis points from 0.75% to 0.25% on 11 March.<Br/>- Macroprudential regulation: On 11 March, the BoE loosened capital buffer requirements loosened to allow banks to take temporary loses without curtailing lending. The countercyclical capital buffer rate was cut to 0%, which is expected to extend the banking sector's capacity to lend to economy by up to GBP 190bn. The Prudential Regulation Authority set out expectations that banks should not increase dividends or bonuses in response to the BoE's policy actions.<Br/>- Liquidity injections: In a move to stabilise bond markets, the Bank also announced an increase of its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by GBP 200 billion to a total of GBP 645 billion, financed by central bank reserves. On 17 March, the BoE together with the UK Treasury announced the joint Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). It provides bridge funding for business to help them cope with cashflow disruptions due to the crisis. The scheme will operate for at least 12 months. The BoE will purchase commercial papers of firms of up to one-year maturity on funding terms comparable to those before the crisis. Firms can use the funding to pay wages and suppliers. Under the Term Funding scheme for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (TFSME), BoE is offering banks four years of cheap funding helping them to continue lending to small enterprises. Funding for banks will be provided at interest rates close to the Bank Rate of 0.1%. Initially envisaged at a size of GBP 100 billion in 2020, the BoE recognised on 19 March that additional funding will be required.

Weekly Main Refinancing Operations: The additional money market liquidity provided to clearing banks via the IOSROs will result in the current money market shortage (MMS) declining below the current target level of R56 billion. The size of the Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) will be kept at R56 billion and increased if necessary.<Br/>3. Standing Facilities:  The Standing Facilities (SF) borrowing rate - the rate at which the SARB absorbs liquidity - will be adjusted to the repo rate less 200 basis points, from the current repo rate less 100 basis points. The SARB deems this change necessary in order to encourage the flow of money market liquidity. The SF lending rate - the rate at which the SARB provides liquidity to the commercial banks - will be adjusted lower to the repo rate, from the prevailing rate of the repo rate plus 100 basis points. This will support banks to facilitate their flow of money market liquidity without being penalised. <Br/>
