Police is controlling the streets and non-compliance with measures is prosecuted as criminal offence. From 7 June until 20 September, the strict confinement only applies to a zone comprising the city and province of Buenos Aires and other provinces, where new Covid cases are concentrated. In other provinces social distancing measures are in place. Since 27 April, provincial governments have the authority to decide on exemptions to the national quarantine, if certain epidemiological criteria are fulfilled, but certain activities remain closed nation-wide (such as school classes, public events, shopping malls, restaurants and bars, recreational and touristic activities, and interregional public transport). Women and members of the LGBT community are explicitly exempt from the quarantine in case they need to report charges due to domestic violence.	2	All borders are entirely closed from 27 March until 20 September.	4	All schools and universities closed as of March 16. Online schooling platforms were introduced.	4	All shops and public spaces are closed from March 20 until 20 September.	3	All shops and public spaces are closed from 20 March until 20 September, only supermarkets, small groceries shops, hardware stores and pharmacies, certain parts of public administration as well as essential production and services activities remain open.

In many provinces, authorities have started to lift containment measures gradually since 27 April and many economic activities have been allowed to resume. From 7 June until 20 September, the strict confinement measures only apply to a zone comprising the city and province of Buenos Aires and other provinces, where new Covid cases are concentrated. From 31 August, construction and open-air restaurants and bars have been allowed to resume activities in the City of Buenos Aires.	2	Public investment will be boosted by around 0.5% of GDP (USD 1.5 bn or 100 billion Pesos), mainly in road infrastructure, housing and school construction as well as infrastructure for tourism. Public credit subsidies for private housing construction will be reinstated and extended, providing opportunities to refurbish homes during confinement, with a focus on domestically produced materials. A specific infrastructure programme with resources of 29 Billion Pesos focuses on social housing as well as gas, electricity and sanitary infrastructure in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Other measures to mitigate the economic costs of the crisis for households and businesses are detailed below.	3.4	732000000000	Twelve new emergency hospitals have been constructed. The government is cooperating with domestic equipment producers and laboratories to increase their supply and has started decentralised testing throughout the country as of 28 March. It has purchased 200,000 reagents for large-scale testing activities and the health system disposes of 8500 Intensive Care Units, which are supposed to be increased to 10,000. All workers in the health sector will receive a monthly bonus of 75 USD from April until July 2020. Prices for personal care, drugs and medical products have been fixed until 30 August at their levels observed 6 March.

Social security contributions and some taxes for companies providing healthcare-related services are reduced during the health emergency situation. The goverment has improved the access to online consultations with doctors, in particular for disadvantaged individuals. In August, the government has announced the joint production with Mexico of a potential vaccine developed by Oxford University, estimated to be ready for distribution during the 1H-2021. 	0.1	20000000000	- Households that live from informal activities, self-employment or domestic work and have suffered income losses will receive a one-off bonus of USD 150 in April, May and June.<Br/><Br/>- Conditional cash transfers to poor families are boosted by a one-off bonus of USD 50.<Br/><Br/>- Retirees and non-contributory pension beneficiaries with minimum pensions will obtain a USD 50 one-off bonus, while other benefits will be topped up to the new level of the regular minimum pension after including the bonus.<Br/><Br/>- Employers are not allowed to fire workers during a period of 180 days (as of 1 April), if the reason is related to the confinement measures or an unfair cause. They are required to pay at least 75% of the salaries of confined private sector workers, who could not continue working from home. For firms that have been strongly affected by the lock down, the state pays up to 50% of the original wage in April, May, June, July and August (find more details under firm support measures).<Br/><Br/>- People aged 60 and above, pregnant women and people in risk groups are dispensed from working and cannot face any negative consequences as a result (employers are required to continue paying the full wage).<Br/><Br/>- Unemployment insurance protection has been reinforced raising benefits for workers dismissed without a fair cause during the lockdown. The duration of unemployment benefits has been extended to 31 December for all unemployed workers, with a coverage of 70% of the original benefit in case of expiration of the original benefit duration.<Br/><Br/>- Public food programmes are expanded.<Br/><Br/>- All workers in the health sector will receive a monthly bonus of 75 USD from April until July.<Br/><Br/>- Workers in the security and public defense sector receive a one-off bonus of USD 75 in April. <Br/><Br/>- On 29 April, all households included in the conditional cash-transfer programme receive a one-off in-kind bonus of 62 USD or 93 USD (if more than one child), which is payed out through a specific credit card only usable for food purchases.<Br/><Br/>- Disadvantaged families that suffered the loss of a family member due to Covid-19 receive a one off bonus of 210 USD.	1.5	318000000000	In sectors particularly affected by the lockdown social security contributions and payroll taxes for employers due in April, May, June, July and August are reduced by 95% or postponed for 2 months.

This measure targets firms most affected by the lockdown, especially small and medium size enterprises. Rates will be around half of current inflation, with an estimated fiscal cost of around 0.33% of GDP. Part of these credits will be directed to companies producing foodstuff, medicaments and hygienic articles as well as equipment necessary for teleworking. To protect banks, soft-credit lines will be guaranteed by the State through a Public Credit Guarantee Fund which has received additional resources from the government. <Br/><Br/>- The public sector provides loans of up to 2300 USD with zero interest rates to self-employed workers whose revenues have strongly decreased due to the crisis. The amount of the loan is equivalent to the average monthly revenue of the self-employed and paid out over three months (with repayment in twelve quotas starting after 6 months). The total fiscal cost of the measure amounts to around 11 billion Pesos and loan guarantees of 26 billion Pesos have been provided by the government. Since August, repayment of new loans for self-employed workers in the culture services sector starts after 12 months.	0.38	376000000000	Public credit guarantees for bank lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) affected by the emergency situation have been reinforced.	Information not available	56000000000	Monetary policy has been loosened considerably with policy rates decreasing by 25 percentage points since January and strong increases in the monetary base in March, April and May.	Bank lending has been encouraged through lower reserve requirements for bank lending to households or SMEs, limits to bank holdings of Central Bank papers, and temporary easing of bank provisioning needs and of bank loan classification rules (i.e. extra 60 days to be classified as non-performing).	- Until 31 December, access to electricity, gas, water as well as phone lines, TV and internet will not be suspended for households unable to pay up to six monthly bills since March 2020.

AUS	ECO	01-Sep-2020	02-Sep-2020	-24.578	133.582	Australia	25435663.9478036	0.681384573453257	1994268245345.8	48162.6105425775	There are vast differences in the stringency of confinement rules across Australian states and territories. While most states are in an advanced stage of reopening, whereby public gatherings are allowed and most industries have restarted operations, the State of Victoria announced a state of disaster on 2 August to curb a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.  New restrictions in Victoria will last a period of six weeks (until Sunday 13 September) and will mean that residents of the state's capital, Melbourne, will be subject to a curfew whereby they must not leave their residence from 8pm to 5am unless it is for essential health, care or safety reasons. Non-essential retail businesses in Melbourne, administration and some manufacturing activity will be halted. Residents in Melbourne will only be permitted to leave their home for one of four reasons: i) one person per household will be allowed to leave once per day to purchase food and necessary supplies from businesses within a five kilometre radius of the home, ii) two people may exercise together for up to one hour within a five kilometre radius of home, iii) for care and health care, iv) travelling to work. Outside of Melbourne, the rest of the state has also increased restrictions, although the four reasons for leaving home are less strictly defined and the extent of industry shutdowns will be more modest. 	2	Only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. From 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020, only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members can travel to Australia. All travellers to Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days. From 28 March, all travellers arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14 day self-isolation at designated facilities. On 24 March, it was announced that Australians are not allowed to take a return trip overseas, unless in exceptional circumstances (in mid-June, the ban was extended and will now run until 17 September). Cruise ships from foreign ports have been banned. Interstate travel is heavily curtailed, with some states such as Western Australia keeping state borders closed and most states banning or heavily restricting entry from Victorian residents. Tasmania had planned to reopen interstate borders to travellers from South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory on 7 August, but this planned reopening has now been pushed back to 31 August. 	5	Primary school and high school students have returned to face to face learning in most states. In some states and territories, university and adult education students are still being urged to work from home where possible. In the State of Victoria, the heightened restrictions announced on 2 August mean that all schools in the state have now moved to remote learning. Schools remain open for vulnerable children and the children of essential workers. Kindergartens and early childhood centres in metropolitan Melbourne are only open for vulnerable children and children whose parents are essential workers. 	1	Depending on the jurisdiction, the maximum permitted size of gatherings varies. In most states, restaurants, museums, galleries, playgrounds, places of worship, pools and gyms are open, albeit with slightly altered operations to allow for physical distancing and stricter hygiene standards. Sportig stadiums in several states have been opened to a limited number of spectators. Consistent with tighter confinement measures in Victoria announced on 2 August, gatherings in Victoria are not permitted. 	1	Most economic activities are now permitted in Australia other than those activities that bring many people together (e.g. entertainment and culture). However, non-essential retail businesses in Melbourne, administration and some manufacturing activity have been shutdown due to stricter restrictions announced by the Victorian government on 2 August. 	1	Total direct spending by Commonwealth Government of A$155bn (7.8% of GDP) and by State Governments of around A$36.9bn (1.5% of GDP). 	9.3	Total direct spending by Commonwealth and State Governments amounts to approximately A$164bn.	On 11 March, the Government committed an additional A$2.4 billion to support the health system to manage any further outbreak in Australia. The package provided support across primary care, aged care, hospitals, research and the National Medical Stockpile, along with a national communication campaign. The package also provided funding to ensure Australia had sufficient personal protective equipment and medicines in addition to infection control training and programs for health and aged care workers.<Br/>On 15 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced that health services had moved into the 'Targeted Action' stage of the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This included moving resources within hospitals to priority areas, establishing fever clinics which specialise in COVID-19, cancelling non-urgent elective surgeries to free up capacity in public hospitals and adapting hospital resources (i.e. rooms and equipment) for use in priority areas, such as Intensive Care Units. <Br/>On 29 March, the Prime Minister announced an additional A$1.1 billion in funding for mental health services, domestic violence support, Medicare assistance for people at home (including through telehealth services) and emergency food relief.<Br/>On 31 March, the Government announced a partnership with private health providers for their infrastructure, essential equipment, supplies, workforce and additional resources to be made available to the public health system. In return, the government would ensure the viability of these enterprises. In essence, this agreement will integrate the private and public health systems in the event that capacity in the public system is strained. <Br/>On 26 April, the government launched the new voluntary app, COVIDSafe. It is intended that the app will help with tracking and tracing COVID-19 infections. <Br/>On 27 April, the first phase in reinstating elective surgeries commenced. Since then, there has been further reintroduction of elective surgery across states and territories. <Br/>	0.3	A$5bn	On 30 March, the Commonwealth Government announced a planned wage subsidy to businesses (A$69bn or 3&frac12;% of GDP) to encourage them to keep workers in jobs. A &ldquo;JobKeeper Payment&rdquo; of A$1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee is being paid to businesses under the condition that every eligible employee receives at least A$1,500 per fortnight from the business. The Jobkeeper Payment covers full-time and part-time employees, as well as employees stood down ahead of the commencement of the scheme, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months and the self-employed. Eligible businesses are those with a turnover of less than A$1 billion that can demonstrate a 30% decline in turnover relative to a comparable month one year ago (firms with turnover of greater than A$1 billion must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in turnover). <Br/>On 21 July 2020, the Government announced it will extend the JobKeeper Payment until 28 March 2021 (it was previously slated to expire at the end of September 2020) and is targeting support to those businesses who continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19. The rate of payments will be reduce from a flat A$1,500 per fortnight per employee to A$1,200 for full-time workers and A$750 for part-time workers, until 3 January. After that, payments will be reduced to A$1,000 and A$650 respectively until the programme finishes at end-March 2021. To remain eligible for the JobKeeper Programme, firms will have to demonstrate that they have met the revenue threshold (a decline of at least 30% compared to year-ago levels for most firms) in the previous two quarters for the Q4 2020 payments, and the previous three quarters for the Q1 2021 payments. The Treasury estimates that the number of employees receiving the payments will fall from around 3&frac12; million to 1.4 million in Q4 2020 and 1 million in Q1 2021. The extension to the payment is estimated to cost A$16.6 billion. <Br/>There has been a temporary expansion of eligibility for income support payments (the JobSeeker Programme) and the establishment of a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of A$550 per fortnight until the end of September 2020.  This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of various government benefits. On 21 July, the government announced that the supplementary payment will be extended to the end of December 2020, but that the size of the payment will be reduced to A$250 per fortnight. New arrangements for the supplement are expected to cost A$3.8 billion.<Br/>Social security and veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders can receive up to two separate cash payments of $750 (those who do not receive the Coronavirus supplement payment will receive the second cash payment of A$750). <Br/>The government has also announced some relaxation of the partner income test for employees applying for unemployment benefits and the Coronavirus Supplement of A$550 per fortnight. An individual can now receive these benefits as long as their partner earns less than A$79,762 per annum (the threshold was previously less than A$48k). <Br/>On August 3, in response to a rise in COVID-19 cases and tighter confinement measures announced in Victoria, the Federal Government announced $1,500 &#34;disaster payment&#34; for workers who are required to self-isolate because of coronavirus but do not have leave entitlements.<Br/>On April 2, a subsidy to childcare providers was announced, conditional on them staying open and not charging families for care. The Commonwealth Government will pay 50 per cent of the sector's fee revenue up to the existing hourly rate cap. The funding will apply from 6 April based on the number of children who were in care during the fortnight leading into 2 March, whether or not they are attending services. The existing arrangements will end in mid-July and be replaced by a three month A$708 million support package to the childcare sector. Families will return to paying for childcare, with the reintroduction of the Child Care Subsidy, but the criteria for families impacted by the economic downturn will be loosened. <Br/>Some labour market regulations have also been temporarily relaxed for the duration of the crisis. Across a large range of work types (103 of the 121 modern awards), employees will receive two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave. The covered employees will also be allowed to take double the duration of annual leave at half pay. There have also been changes to three specific awards that cover about 2 million workers, those related to restaurants, hospitality and the clerks award. These changes will allow an individual worker who was performing one type of duty in one type of classification perform another type of duty in another type of classification.<Br/>	5.7	A$112bn	New Commonwealth Government measures include support for business investment, including by increasing the threshold for assets eligible for instant tax write-off and expanding access to this regime to larger firms (with annual turnover of <500 million AUD up from <50 million AUD), as well as through new accelerated depreciation measures. Measures have also been implemented to support business cash flows (including through payments to SMEs that employ workers to help finance payments of salaries and wages plus wage subsidies to SMEs to support them in retaining apprentices and trainees). <Br/><Br/><Br/>	1.86	A$38bn	Information not available	--		On 12 March, the Australian Taxation Office announced a range of measures to allow firms that are affected by the pandemic to defer payment of tax liabilities for up to 4 months without incurring interests or penalties for late payment (incl. for income taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excises and fringe benefits tax). These have been complemented with measures to accelerate tax refunds, notably of excess input-GST credits.<Br/>The government has also announced the HomeBuilder programme to support residential construction activity in the second half of 2020. The programme will provide all eligible owner-occupiers with a grant of A$25,000 to build a new home or substantially renovate an existing home. Construction must be contracted to commence within three months of the contract date. Applicants are subject to eligibility criteria, including caps on household income and the price of a new home or renovation. The program is expected to provide around 27,000 grants at a total cost of around $680 million.<Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Under a new Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, the Government is guaranteeing 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The total lending capacity of the facility is A$40bn (2% of GDP). Loans written until 30 June 2021 will be eligible. Under a plan put forward by the banking industry, businesses with up to A$10mn in total loan facilities will be able to defer their loan repayments for six months.	2	A$40bn	The central bank cash rate was cut by 25 basis points on 3 March. Then, on 19 March, the central bank announced additional measures including 1) A reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent (from 0.5 per cent); 2) A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent; 3) the introduction of a A$90bn (4.5% of GDP) term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses; 4) Exchange Settlement Balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at a rate of 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under previous arrangements. <Br/>The government will also allocate AUD15bn (0.7% of GDP) to the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in wholesale funding markets used by smaller lenders. <Br/>On 1 September, the central bank increased the size of the term funding facility to A$200 (10% of GDP) and extended the duration of this lending programme until the end of June 2021.<Br/>	On 19 March, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced that it would tolerate bank capital levels that were below benchmark capital targets as long as institutions demonstrate that they can meet their various minimum capital requirements. On 20 March, the central bank announced that it would establish a temporary reciprocal currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve for the provision of US dollar liquidity. 	The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Eligible individuals will be able to apply for the scheme until 31 December 2020. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  	0.1	A$2bn	On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants. On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.	--		The Commonwealth and State and Territory governments are joint funding the $1billion JobTrainer Fund, which aims to provide an additional 340,700 training places to help school leavers and job seekers access short and long training courses.

(i) The capital of the Bulgarian Development Bank (BDB) was increased by BGN 700 million of which BGN 500 million will be used to issue portfolio guarantees (with 80% coverage of loan principal) to commercial banks to enable them to provide more flexible business unsecured loans for a specified period under certain conditions and individual case-by-case assessment. This was part of the package approved under the Law on the amendment of the 2020 State Budget Act (approved by partliament on April 6). The guarantees period is 5 years. The amount of loans is up to BGN 300,000 provided by commercial banks, the volume of the program is BGN 2 billion and is accessible to all business sectors in all regions of Bulgaria. Eligible borrowers are micro as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in accordance with the SME Law. It is expected that sectors most affected by the crisis will benefit from the instrument, mainly trade, transport, hotels and restaurant, logistics, also export-orient companies and others. The grace period for payment of interest and principal is up to 36 months. Application deadline for the program is by the end of 2020. The eligibility criteria are:<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Decrease in turnover starting the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 (based on the financial statements of the company);<Br/><Br/>- Existence of receivables from customers that have not been received / amounts not paid to suppliers after 01.03.2020 (based on the financial statements of the company);<Br/><Br/>- Discontinued import supplies required for the enterprise's activity <Br/>- after 01.01.2020, cancelled export contracts (based on certificates and documents submitted by the company);<Br/><Br/>- Sickness and self-isolation of employees, overall reduction in the number of employees, closed production facilities and offices (based on certificates and documents provided by the company).<Br/>The remaining BGN 200 mln will guarantee interest-free consumer loans with the amount of BGN 1500 <Br/>- 4500. The maximum amount of BGN 4500 could be drawn at one time or in three tranches of BGN 1500 each. If a smaller amount of the loan is initially allowed, it can be annexed subsequently in order to reach the amount of BGN 4500. So far 12 commercial banks have declared interest in participating in this measure. The lending decisions under those programs will depend on the banks and remain market-based. No fees, commissions or penalties will be due for the loans.<Br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (ii) The Government also activated financial instruments with a public resource through the Fund Manager (the Fund of funds). The main role of the Fund is to implement financial instruments in Bulgaria via facilities using EU funds and private resources. The financial instruments financed from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIFs) are specialised funding schemes where the Fund of Funds provides financing, via financial intermediaries and banks, in the form of guarantees, loans and equity investments to various target groups of final recipients. In the current exceptional circumstances, the Fund is focusing efforts on several main areas:                                                                                                               <Br/><Br/>- Loans to provide liquidy support to SMEs <Br/>- One of the measures is a guarantee product that provides liquidity support to small and medium-sized enterprises operating in various sectors, including those most affected by the crisis, such as tourism, transport, wholesale and retail trade, etc. The Fund of Funds will provide banks with guarantees totalling to BGN 170 million that will back up new loans of up to BGN 850 million in terms of one year. The amount of financing is up to BGN 3.6 million, mainly for working capital, with the possibility of providing long-term investment loans up to a maximum of ten years. The goal is to enable such lending without any additional administrative burden for the loan applicants. In addition, an extended grace period for the principal amounts is envisaged. <Br/><Br/><Br/>- Micro loans programme <Br/>- this measure provides support to self-employed individuals and small start-ups having a very short business track record, if any, including those set up by vulnerable groups (people with disabilities, young people aged 29 or less, people who have been unemployed for more than 6 months). This is a facility for granting concessional loans, including without any collateral, to target groups of final recipients who usually have no access to bank financing due to a lack of credit history. The aim of the instrument is to retain employment levels by supporting small businesses, including those run by self-employed persons. The amount available for this measure totals BGN 24 mln, with the possibility of supplying additional funds, should the facility be exhausted rapidly. The loans are extended via financial intermediaries that have capacity and branch networks in all of the 28 districts of Bulgaria. Eligible undertakings could receive up to BGN 50 000 leva in working capital loans funds and investments under more favourable conditions and at interest terms below market rates.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Funds for private equity in start-ups and innovative companies -this measure is in the field of venture equity investments in start-ups and innovative businesses, and amounts to BGN 150 million This instrument is designed to support companies that have the potential to contribute in the rapid economic recovery after the crisis, especially in key areas of innovation and digitalization, as well as make investments in high tech such as bio and nanotechnology, mechatronics, green technology and IT, pharmaceuticals, fintech, where such investments can bring added value. Considering that start-ups and fast-growing companies are facing so far unpredictable challenges, the Fund of Funds is focusing its efforts mainly on accelerating investments and providing more favourable conditions. The amount of investment varies over a wide range according to the stage of development of the companies. The average value is BGN 800 thousand in the form of equity investments, i.e. investments in the capital of the companies or convertible debt in return for which the investor is entitled to acquire participation in the capital of the company under certain conditions.<Br/><Br/><Br/>- Funds for urban development <Br/>- the Fund will continue to finance municipal and other projects aimed at improving the urban environment, with a facility amounting to BGN 418 million available through its urban development funds. This financial instrument is targeted at 39 Bulgarian municipalities and public and private urban development projects. This support is for infrastructure projects, cultural centers and tourist objects with national and global importance, development of economic zones which is key for the economy in times of crisis, given the lack of financing alternatives on the market. It is envisaged to further ease the conditions in the direction of greater guarantee coverage, as well as for projects and companies in the most affected sectors of the crisis such as tourism and transport. The amount of financing can reach up to BGN 40 million and is mainly aimed at investments, with the possibility of providing also working capital financing.

The regional council announced that it will go ahead with the election plans, which will be held before the end of Ethiopian year (September 11, 2020). Further, the Council also extended the regional State of Emergency by two and half months, despite the COVID-19 five-month state of emergency order in place at the federal level. <Br/>*June 8: Ethiopian PM addressed the parliament and touched on various issues related to COVID-19 and supported the decision not to halt EA flights to China and other countries. He also defended the Government's decision not to enforce strict lockdowns, and claimed measures to contain the virus should be based on local realities. <Br/>*April 24: The northern (Tigray) region of Ethiopia has eased the State of Emergency and lockdown measures. Under the new conditions civil servants will be returning to work and movements within the region will be allowed. Other activities will be allowed under strict social distancing measures (i.e only take-away services will be allowed for restaurants and bars).                    <Br/>*The region also implemented a 14 day mandatory quarantine for any passengers arriving via the regional airpot and land. 	3	*July 13: Ethiopian Airlines, resumed flights to 40 destinations, after suspending 80 flight routes at the beginning of the lockdown measures. <Br/>*June 19: Ethiopia started to relax some of its preventative measures for COVID-19, the quarantine period for travellers from abroad has been shortened from 14 to 7 days. Travellers must have certificates for COVID-19 negative, which must be issued 72 hours before their arrival to Ethiopia. Those without certificates will be put in mandatory quarantine of 7 days, and additional 7 days of isolation at home. Additionally, families are now allowed to hold funerals for relatives with a limit of maximum 15 persons.  <Br/>*March 23: The authorities have closed borders.<Br/>	3	*March 16: Schools have been shut down.	4	*August 27: Ethiopia COVID-19 State of Emergency Inquiry Board has recommended to release prisoners who qualify for pardon, in order to reduce the spread of the virus. Following the political unrests in June 2020, over 9000 persons were detained, and public spaces such as schools, town halls and warehouses were converted into detention facilities, raising concerns of increased spread of the pandemic. The request has been submitted to the executive bodies of the House of the Peoples' representatives. <Br/><Br/><Br/>*June 29: Ethiopia's Government COVID-19 statistics updates have been interrupted due to the internet blackout in the country. The last updates from national sources such as Ethiopia's Health Ministry and the Public Health Institute, took place on June 29. The WHO Regional Office for Africa continues to report figures on its social media account, which the Organisation collects from verified sources.<Br/>*June 10: General elections meant to reconstitute a new parliament and originally to take place on August 29 have been postponed until international health institutions have deemed the threat from coronavirus to be over. By the same token, Ethiopia's upper parliamentary chamber, the House of Federation (HoF), has approved an extension to the mandate of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's parliament as well as regional parliaments and councils.<Br/>*May 7: The regional government of Tigray region (TPLF) vows to go ahead with elections despite the national elections being postponed from August 2020.<Br/>*Public gatherings are prohibited.<Br/>*April 1: The National Electoral Board postponed the parliamentary elections of 29 August 2020.    <Br/>*Some schools <Br/>- below seventh grade <Br/>- have started broadcasting teaching via radio.	2	*March 23: The authorities have shut down nightclubs and entertainment outlets. 	4	*June 11: Finance ministers of East Africa are expected to present their up to date budget for the new financial year starting from July the 1. The reading of the regional budget is normally a joint exercise among member countries. It is expected that COVID-19 has put extra  pressure on government budgets, due to reduction in fiscal revenues and deterioration of economic outlook. East African fiscal finances are expected to have bigger deficits than what was expected few months ago and public debt is expected to increase at faster rate. However, authorities are expected to carefully monitor their budgets to avoid deficit, and allocate fiscal resources where necessary, including health care, and social support sectors. <Br/>*May 29: A supplementary budget of USD 1.43 billion has been approved by the parliament, for the fiscal year 2019/20. The budget aims to support humanitarian and medical assistance and to reduce the economic ramification of Covid19, for the estimated 30 million people who are considered to be in need of government assistance. The budget will be funded by a mix of loans from internal and external sources. <Br/>*March 23: the Prime Minister announced the aid package announced earlier on would be increased to Br 5 billion (US$154 million or 0.15 percent of GDP) but details on the precise modalities of the assistance are not yet available.                                                                                                                                            *Early March: Ethiopia initially announced a Br 300 million package to bolster healthcare spending. <Br/>*April 3: The GOE announced the Multi-Sectoral Preparedness and Response Plan, to be implemented over 3 months. The USD1.64 billion plan aims to support various economic sectors and population groups including: USD 635M for distribution of food to vulnerable population groups who are not covered by the national social protection programme; USD 430M to be allocated on health care response under assumed worst case scenario COVID-19 cases of over 100 000 cases of COVID 19, especially in urban areas; USD282M for provision of emergency shelter and non-food items; and USD 293M will be allocated to agriculture, nutrition , and protection of vulnerable groups such as refugees and site management support.

EU	ECO	07-Aug-2020	07-Aug-2020	55	4.5	European Union	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	On March 17, EU Member States agreed to restrict non-essential travel to the European Union for an initial period of 30 days. The Commission subsequently recommended to extend restrictions three times, until 30 June. Exceptions mainly cover EU and British citizens, long-time residents, cross-border commuters, health care workers and workers delivering goods. Movement of goods is not to be affected. On June 11, the Commission proposed a coordinated lifting of restrictions from 1 July, starting with a common list of third countries selected together by Member States.  For the remaining third countries, the Commission proposed to enlarge the categories of permitted travellers to include, for instance, international students. On 30 June, the Council of the EU recommended that, as from 1 July, member states start lifting restrictions for residents of a list of third countries, with the list to be regularly reviewed.	1	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	Information not available	* The EUR 37 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII; proposed on 13 March, in force since 1 April) will accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy (total country allocations for the 2014-2020 period remain unchanged). Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April and in force since 24 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April). Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.<Br/><Br/>* At the request of Member States, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed (up to EUR 179 million available in 2020)<Br/><Br/>*   EUR 1 billion has been provided as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group) to support SME financing (announced on 13 March, implemented on 6 April). <Br/><Br/>* On 9 April, EU finance ministers decided to establish Pandemic Crisis Support credit lines within the framework of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Access granted will be 2% of the respective country's GDP as of end-2019, as a benchmark (about &euro;240 billion in total). The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. The only requirement to access the credit line is that euro area Member States requesting support would commit to use this credit line to finance direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis. On 8 May, the Eurogroup agreed on further details: requests for Pandemic Crisis Support may be made until end-2022 (with the possibility to adjust this deadline) and the ensuing loans to countries will have a maximum average maturity of 10 years and favourable pricing modalities. On May 15, the Board of Governors of the ESM approved the establishment of Pandemic Crisis Support.<Br/><Br/><Br/>* The Commission intends to allow State aid for struggling businesses. In particular, the Commission considers that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is causing a serious disturbance to the entire EU economy (Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty). In this context, the Commission adopted on 19 March a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules. This Framework was extended on 3 April, 8 May and 29 June to cover additional types of aid. It will be in place until end-2020 (for recapitalisation measures, until end of June 2021).<Br/><Br/>* The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group announced on 16 March a plan (currently being deployed) to mobilize up to EUR 40 billion of financing to alleviate liquidity and working capital constraints for SMEs and mid-caps. This comprises dedicated guarantee schemes to banks based on existing programmes, dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and dedicated asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programmes to allow banks to transfer risk on portfolios of SME loans.<Br/><Br/>* In addition to the above plan, EU finance ministers endorsed on 9 April an EIB proposal to create a EUR 25 billion guarantee fund, which will support up to EUR 200 billion of financing for companies (especially SMEs) throughout the EU. The scheme will be implemented by the EIB Group, in close partnership with national promotional banks and other financial intermediaries. By guaranteeing parts of loan portfolios, operations under the guarantee fund will free up capital for the financial intermediaries involved to make further financing available for SMEs and mid-caps. On 26 May, the Board of Directors of the EIB agreed on the structure and business model of this new <Br/>Pan-European Guarantee Fund. The fund will initially approve operations until end-2021 (a deadline which can be extended), and at least 65% of the financing will go to SMEs.<Br/><Br/>* The Commission presented on 2 April a proposal for a new European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE). SURE support will take the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States, to help them cover the costs directly related to the creation or extension of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures for the self-employed, in the context of the current crisis. EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. An instrument along these lines was endorsed by EU finance ministers on 9 April. On May 20, a Regulation establishing SURE entered into force. Countries will be able to use loans also in support of some health-related measures, esp. in the workplace. SURE will become available once all Member States have provided the required guarantees proportionally to gross national income, and will remain available until end-2022 (with the possibility to adjust this deadline).<Br/><Br/>* On 27 May the European Commission presented its proposal of a recovery plan of EUR 750 billion (about 5.5% of EU27 2019 GDP). This plan, named Next Generation EU, is embedded within the 2021-27 EU budget, strengthening some of the previously proposed budget programmes and creating new instruments. It envisages 3 strands of support over the next 4 years (2021-2024):<Br/>1. Support to Member States with investments and reforms<Br/><Br/>- A new Recovery and Resilience Facility to help finance investment and reforms in line with the priorities of the European Semester (EUR 560 billion, of which EUR 310 billion in grants and EUR 250 billion in loans)<Br/><Br/>- A new REACT-EU initiative, providing a top-up to current cohesion policy programmes, to be spent until 2022 (EUR 50 billion)<Br/><Br/>- A reinforcement of the Just Transition Fund, which will support the transition to climate neutrality (EUR 30 billion)<Br/><Br/>- A reinforcement of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EUR 15 billion)<Br/>2. Kick-starting the EU economy by incentivising private investments<Br/><Br/>- A new Solvency Support Instrument, aiming to mobilise private resources to support viable firms in the sectors, regions and countries most affected (EUR 26 billion of guarantees)<Br/><Br/>- A reinforcement of InvestEU, the main EU investment programme, including a new Strategic Investment Facility to generate investments in boosting the resilience of strategic sectors and key value chains in the internal market (EUR 30.3 billion of guarantees)<Br/>3. Addressing the lessons of the crisis<Br/><Br/>- New or reinforced programmes in the areas of health, R&D, civil protection and external action, including humanitarian aid (EUR 38.7 billion) <Br/>Overall, the plan envisages EUR 250 billion of loans, about EUR 50 billion of guarantees and almost EUR 450 billion of grants, with a focus on the sectors and regions most severely affected by the pandemic. The plan will be financed through borrowing by the Commission on financial markets, which entails temporarily increasing the Own Resources ceiling (the maximum amount of funds that the EU can request from Member States to cover its financial obligations) by 0.6% of EU gross national income. However, this acts like a guarantee, and should not entail actual additional disbursements by Member States over 2021-27 (in this period, even the borrowing costs for the grant component of the Plan will be paid by the EU budget). Repayment will take place through future EU budgets between 2028 and 2058. This will entail increased contributions by Member States and/or new own resources, which could be related to carbon emissions or include a digital tax. The Commission will present detailed proposals of additional own resources at a later stage.<Br/>On 21 July, the European Council reached an agreement on a modified version of the plan. The amounts for the different strands of support have become:<Br/><Br/>- Recovery and Resilience Facility: EUR 672.5 billion, of which EUR 312.5 billion in grants and EUR 360 billion in loans<Br/><Br/>- REACT-EU: EUR 47.5 billion<Br/><Br/>- Just Transition Fund: EUR 10 billion<Br/><Br/>- European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development: EUR 7.5 billion<Br/><Br/>- Solvency Support Instrument: dropped<Br/><Br/>- InvestEU: EUR 5.6 billion<Br/><Br/>- R&D and civil protection programmes: EUR 6.9 billion<Br/>While preserving the EUR 750 million total, grants have been reduced from about EUR 450 billion to about EUR 385 billion, and more than half of this reduction has fallen on programmes directly managed by the Commission and for which there are no national envelopes (such as Horizon Europe, an R&D programme). The guarantees component has been very strongly downsized, and the loans component has increased.<Br/>As regards the Recovery and Resilience Facility, 70% of the grants will be committed in 2021 and 2022 according to the cross-country allocation key proposed by the Commission (based on population, GDP per capita and unemployment), and the remaining 30% in 2023 according to a somewhat modified key (replacing the 2015-2019 unemployment criterion by the GDP fall in 2020 and the cumulative GDP fall over 2020-21). Preliminary estimates point to a relatively small impact of this modification, with about half of the grants still expected to go to southern European countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). As for oversight of the national use of funds under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the July agreement gives a role to the Economic and Financial Committee (a preparatory body of the Council of the EU) and, in some cases, to the European Council itself.	Information not available	Information not available	* The Commission has been pursuing joint public procurements of protective equipment, which reinforces member states' negotiating position towards the industry.<Br/><Br/>* On 19 March, the Commission decided to create a European civil protection stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks. Member states wishing to host the stockpile will procure the equipment, financed with a 90% Commission grant. The initial EU budget of the stockpile was EUR 50 million, subsequently increased to EUR 80 million. Distribution of the equipment will be managed at EU level.<Br/><Br/>* On 2 April, the Commission presented a legislative proposal (in force since 15 April) to activate and extend the scope of the Emergency Support Instrument, with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget to directly purchase or procure emergency support on behalf of Member States, financially support and co-ordinate pressing needs such as the transportation of medical equipment and of patients in cross-border regions, and support the construction of mobile field hospitals.<Br/><Br/>	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	--		* The ECB took several measures to support bank lending and liquidity throughout the euro area:<Br/>o 12 March: lowering the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 (25 basis points below the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations).<Br/>o 12 March: conducting additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) temporarily (with an interest rate equal to the average rate on the deposit facility, -0.50% currently).<Br/>o 18 March, further detailed on 7 April: easing collateral standards to give easier access to ECB liquidity, by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework. These measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, include expanding the use of credit claims as collateral, reducing collateral valuation haircuts and taking a number of other temporary steps, such as a waiver to accept Greek sovereign debt instruments as collateral.<Br/>o 22 April: adopting temporary measures, due to remain in place until September 2021, to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades. More specifically, the ECB will grandfather the eligibility of marketable assets and the issuers of such assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 in the event of downgrades, as long as the ratings remain at or above BB.<Br/>o 30 April: reducing further the interest rate applied in targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) until June 2021, to 50 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/>o 30 April: conducting a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). These will consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations.<Br/><Br/>* The ECB also took measures to reinforce the asset purchase programme (APP):<Br/>o 12 March: adding a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion until the end of the year.<Br/>o 18 March: furthermore, launching a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP) with an overall envelope of EUR 750 billion until the end of 2020. Together, both envelopes amount to 7.3% of euro area GDP. Some self-imposed purchase limits will not apply to the PEPP.<Br/>o 18 March: expanding the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper. <Br/>o 4 June: increasing the envelope for the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) by EUR 600 billion to a total of EUR 1350 billion, and extending the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021. Furthermore, the maturing principal payments from PEPP purchases will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022.	* Major banks (i.e. those directly supervised by the ECB) will be allowed to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The ECB considers that these temporary measures will be enhanced by the appropriate relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities (12 March). In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March), and announced a temporary reduction in capital requirements for market risk (16 April). On 28 July, the ECB extended its recommendation to banks not to pay dividends and not to buy back shares until 1 January 2021 and asked them to be extremely moderate with regard to variable remuneration. The ECB also clarified that it will give enough time for banks to replenish their capital and liquidity buffers, with the exact timeline to be decided following the 2021 EU-wide stress test and on a case-by-case basis.<Br/><Br/>* On 28 April, the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation (EU) 575/2013) to provide temporary capital relief to banks. Changes, in force since 27 June, include inter alia extending by 2 years the current transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital, a later date of application of the leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important institutions, a more favourable treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the NPL prudential backstop (the minimum loss coverage requirement for non-performing loans), and advancing the date of application of capital reduction factors in respect of certain loans to SMEs or in support of infrastructure investments.<Br/><Br/>* On 24 July, the European Commission adopted a Capital Markets Recovery Package, proposing targeted changes to capital market rules (Prospectus Regulation, MiFID II and securitisation rules). Amendments to the Prospectus Regulation envisage the temporary creation of new type of short-form prospectus (the &ldquo;EU Recovery Prospectus&rdquo;), applicable under certain conditions, to make it easier for issuers to quickly raise capital. Amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) include inter alia steps to reduce administrative burdens for experienced investors in their business-to-business relationships. Changes to securitisation rules (Securitisation Regulation, Capital Requirements Regulation) aim to facilitate the use of securitisation to support the recovery by enabling banks to expand their lending. The Commission proposes to create a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised on-balance-sheet securitisation that would benefit from a preferential prudential treatment and to facilitate the securitisation of non-performing exposures.

The filing and payment date will be delayed to 31 October 2020, providing cash flow relief of close to R2 billion.<Br/>2) A deferral for the payment of excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products: Due to the restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, payments due in May 2020 and June 2020 will be deferred by 90 days for excise compliant businesses to more closely align tax payments through the duty-at-source system (excise duties are imposed at the point of production) with retail sales. This is expected to provide short term assistance of around R6 billion. A). Tax-compliant businesses with a turnover of less than R50m will be allowed to delay 20% of their pay-as-you-earn liabilities over the next four months and a portion of their provisional corporate income tax payments without penalties or interest over the next six months.

This facility will offer working capital, stock, bridging finance, order finance and equipment finance, and the amount provided will be based on the funding needs of the business. 	3.93510514289954	200000000000	On the 23rd of July the Reserve Bank decided to further cut the repurshasing rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%. ///On the 21st of May the Reserve Bank decided to further cut the repurshasing rate by 50 basis points to 3.75% // i. On the 14 of April, the Reserve Bank decided a further cut of 100 basis points to 4.25% of the repo rate. // ii. Monetary policy rates: On the 19th of March the Reserve Bank decided to cut the repo rate from 6.25 to 5.25%. <Br/>iii. liquidity injections: On March 20, the Reserve Bank announced three measures to ease money market liquidity:<Br/>1. Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations: The SARB will, through its Open Market Operations Desk, conduct Intraday Overnight Supplementary Repurchase Operations (IOSROs) to provide intraday liquidity support to clearing banks, except on Wednesdays, when the main repurchase transaction is conducted. IOSROs will be carried out through a fixed-rate auction with a pro-rata allotment, with an interest rate that is equal to the repurchase (repo) rate. <Br/>2. Weekly Main Refinancing Operations: The additional money market liquidity provided to clearing banks via the IOSROs will result in the current money market shortage (MMS) declining below the current target level of R56 billion. The size of the Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) will be kept at R56 billion and increased if necessary.<Br/>3. Standing Facilities:  The Standing Facilities (SF) borrowing rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB absorbs liquidity <Br/>- will be adjusted to the repo rate less 200 basis points, from the current repo rate less 100 basis points. The SARB deems this change necessary in order to encourage the flow of money market liquidity. The SF lending rate <Br/>- the rate at which the SARB provides liquidity to the commercial banks <Br/>- will be adjusted lower to the repo rate, from the prevailing rate of the repo rate plus 100 basis points. This will support banks to facilitate their flow of money market liquidity without being penalised. 	1) The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of banks has been reduced from 100% to 80% (Directive 1 of 2020); 2) Temporary capital relief is provided in a manner which still complies with international standards. The Regulations provide that banks shall have in place robust policies, processes and procedures to ensure that the bank continuously maintains, in addition to the base minimum capital requirement of eight per cent of risk weighted assets, a systemic risk capital requirement (Pillar 2A), an idiosyncratic risk capital requirement (Pillar 2b), a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical buffer (CCyB) and a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) buffer. Both the CCyB and D-SIB buffers, when imposed, are an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The relief provided is that the Pillar 2A requirement is reduced to zero. South Africa has not implemented the countercyclical capital buffers as there has not been an excess aggregate credit extension thus banks are not required to maintain capital for systemic risk. Banks have built up a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent stipulated in terms of Regulation 38(8)(e)(D) hence banks are permitted to draw down from this buffer in this period of financial distress. the relief in response to the Covid-19 pandemic for banks to extend credit in the real economy and not for banks to distribute dividends. The Pillar 2A capital requirement will be re-imposed on banks after the financial stress period as will be directed by the PA. (Directive 2 of 2020). 3) The PA issued Directive 3 of 2020, which signals approval of the actions taken by banks to assist borrowers. This includes selected short-term payment holidays and loan restructures. The PA is providing credit risk capital relief to banks. Loans had to be up to date on 29 February 2020 in order to qualify for the relief. Retail (which include residential mortgage advances, retail revolving credit, SME retail and retail other) and corporate (which include corporate, SME corporate and the various specialised lending asset classes) would be able to qualify. A)Prudential authority issued a proposal on March 26 effective from April 1st, which includes dropping minimum capital requirements and compulsory reserve funds for lenders, reducing the liquidity coverage ratio to 80% from 100% and relaxing accounting standards when determining potential losses.
